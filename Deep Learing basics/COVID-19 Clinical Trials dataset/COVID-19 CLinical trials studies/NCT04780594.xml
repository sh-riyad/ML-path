  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has been a challenge for hospitals; there was an obvious need to reconvert many&#xD;
      spaces in specific areas to attend this pathology, without forgetting the attention to other&#xD;
      pathologies and surgery. The objective of the investigators is to evaluate the impact of this&#xD;
      pandemic in the patients who underwent surgery in Bellvitge University Hospital, analyzing 2&#xD;
      periods of time: the months before the COVID-19 peak and the COVID-19 peak months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 2.530 procedures have been evaluated in this retrospective observational study.&#xD;
      Two groups have been generated (pre-pandemic period and pandemic period), classified into&#xD;
      scheduled and emergency surgery. The investigators determined age, type of surgery and&#xD;
      specialty, hospital stay, destination at discharge including mortality and severity according&#xD;
      to Diagnostic Related to Group (DRG) scale. The investigators have also determined the number&#xD;
      of confirmed COVID-19 infections in patients who underwent surgery during these 2 periods and&#xD;
      evaluated if the infection was due to a nosocomial infection (confirmation of the COVID-19&#xD;
      during the hospitalization period). Comparisons were made between subgroups: scheduled&#xD;
      surgery performed during the 2 periods and emergency surgery performed during the 2 periods.&#xD;

    <description>Administrative database was automatically collected. That included demographic, clinical antecedents, surgical team and surgical procedure, primary and secondary diagnoses and principal and secondary surgical procedures. A case-mix grouping system administrative automatic recorded based on the ICD-10-AM International Classification of Diseases. According to the Diagnoses-related Groups (DRG's). the Severity of Illness Index assigns to each patient an overall severity score (from 1 to 4) and mortality risk score (from 1 to 4)</description>

        The requirement to include patients was that they required surgery, either urgent or&#xD;
        scheduled, during the periods described (PreCOVID and COVID). As there is no paediatric&#xD;
        service in the hospital, the minimum age of the sample is 18 years old but there is no&#xD;
        maximum age for inclusion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Minor-intermediate surgery that involves discharge from the hospital on the same day&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Procedures related to medical treatment or complications of COVID-19 patients, such as&#xD;
             chest tubes, extracorporeal oxygenation or tracheostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those scheduled elective surgery patients in the Covid period that resulted RT-PCR&#xD;
