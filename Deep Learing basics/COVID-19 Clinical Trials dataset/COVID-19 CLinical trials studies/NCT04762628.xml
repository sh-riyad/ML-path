  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SaiseiCovUKR clinical study is a multicentric, randomize trail study targeting&#xD;
      hospitalize with COVID-19 patients who not requiring the mechanical ventilation. This study&#xD;
      aims to provide preliminary data on the activity and safety of MAF capsules and M capsules in&#xD;
      the target population after 14 days of dosing. MAF capsules and M capsules are dietary&#xD;
      supplements targeting gut's mucosal immunity to control local and systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      limiting epithelial damage and prevent the accumulation of pathological macrophage&#xD;
      populations in sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

      SaiSei Pharma is developing biologics using an enzymatical modification Vitamin D binging&#xD;
      protein and other glycoproteins in biological substrates, which shown to in increase&#xD;
      macrophages phagocytic and antigen processing activity without promoting proinflammatory&#xD;
      profile on macrophages. Bovine colostrum is substrate MAF capsules and bovine whey for M&#xD;
      capsules. Enteric capsules formulation of investigational dietary supplements targeting gut&#xD;
      mucosa and its associated natural anti-inflammatory macrophages profile. The SaiseiCovUKR&#xD;
      clinical study is multicentric, randomize, open-label in hospitalized with moderate and&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 participants to provide data on the activity and safety of MAF capsules and M&#xD;
      capsules in the target population after 14 days of dosing. The trial will use an adaptive&#xD;
      design based on pre-specified criteria, using an independent external Data Monitoring&#xD;
      Committee (DMC) to monitor safety, efficacy, and review data at appropriate intervals. The&#xD;
      general objectives of the study are to obtain preliminary indication of activity of MAF&#xD;
      capsules and M capsules on shortening time to the recovery and decreasing mortality in the&#xD;
      target population (600 patients, age â‰¥ 18 years). The study results can provide a background&#xD;
      for further investigation of studied dietary supplements as new drugs in COVID-19.&#xD;
