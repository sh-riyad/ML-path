  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TB006, a monoclonal antibody, is an anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic agent that reduces&#xD;
      the severity of underlying diseases in COVID-19 patients. The primary objective of TB006&#xD;
      treatment is to decrease the potential acute severe deterioration in outpatient COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with underlying diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer. TB006 has been&#xD;
      developed to treat the ambulatory patients with diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 who are&#xD;
      considered at high risk for severe disease or hospitalization. The preferred population&#xD;
      includes patients with elevated cytokines (e.g., IL-6) at baseline and patients with&#xD;
      underlying diseases at baseline including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases (such as&#xD;
      hypertension), and cancer.&#xD;

&#xD;
      In the single ascending dose study, the dosages of 10 mg/kg ~ 50 mg/kg will be investigated&#xD;
      in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, and will be administered to patients over 60&#xD;
      minutes after dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) to a final&#xD;
      volume of 250 mL. The primary objective of the SAD study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of single ascending doses of TB006 vs placebo administered via i.v. infusion in&#xD;
      outpatient patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and to determine the dose recommended for&#xD;
      Phase Ib study.&#xD;

In addition, a sentinel cohort of 5 mg/kg will be open for enrollment and double-blinded randomization first, with 2 patients randomized to active/TB006 arm, to assess preliminary safety and tolerability of study drug, and to determine cohort expansion and dose escalation. Upon the completion of sentinel cohort and all subjects are safe and well tolerate study treatment, regular dose escalation will start.</description>
