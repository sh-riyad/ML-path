  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide clinical decision support to healthcare professionals&#xD;
      using a wearable for non-invasive multimodal monitoring, allowing early detection of disease&#xD;
      progression to severe forms, as well as the detection of significant clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the development of the study, 500 individuals with COVID-19 in home confinement will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to form part of the control group, which will be followed conventionally by&#xD;
      Primary Care Professionals, or to the experimental group, which will also be provided with&#xD;
      the wearable device for non-invasive multimodal monitoring linked to an App for transfering&#xD;
      data. Furthermore, the patient will be able to interact with the application on three times&#xD;
      daily by indicating the symptoms contemplated and answering the decision clinical questions.&#xD;
      In this way, alarms can be generated in the presence of symptoms or significant alterations&#xD;
      in the parameters monitored by the device, which the health professionals of the Primary Care&#xD;
      teams included in the study will evaluate at the appropriate time, taking the best decision&#xD;
      in each case.&#xD;

      As variables to be considered in order to compare the effectiveness of the system against the&#xD;
      conventional monitoring protocol, complemented with real-time patient notification of&#xD;
      symptoms, certain variables will be collected, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, sex, date of COVID-19 positive diagnosis (PCR or antigen test).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage of clinical progression of the disease: according to the Primary Care COVID-19&#xD;
           management&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information collected in the telephone clinical assessment questionnaire in the home&#xD;
           follow-up of the patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables generated by the study follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs covered by the Bakeey E66 smartwatch device: temperature, respiration rate&#xD;
           (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SatO2)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical symptoms covered by the Home App for submission by the patient: cough, fever,&#xD;
           chest pain, respiratory distress (dyspnoea), vomiting and diarrhoea.&#xD;
