  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although several therapeutic agents have been suggested for the treatment of the disease&#xD;
      caused by the Coronavirus of the year 2019 (COVID-19), no antiviral has yet demonstrated&#xD;
      consistent efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study comparing Tenofovir-DF (disoproxil fumarate) (TDF) with&#xD;
      Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with&#xD;
      evidence of pulmonary compromise and with supplemental oxygen required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 2020 to May 30, 2020 at the &quot;Hospital&#xD;
      Nacional Carlos Alberto Seguín Escobedo (CASE)-EsSalud&quot; (Arequipa, Peru) with a PCR-confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes to be compared will be mortality, the need for admission to the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and / or Mechanical Ventilation, and LOS (length of stay) in both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, demographic factors, risk factors, vital / respiratory functions, and laboratory&#xD;
      results of both groups will be compared. The tests closest to the time of admission to the&#xD;
      hospital will be taken into consideration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: quantitative variables will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation,&#xD;
      qualitative variables will be expressed as percentages (%). In the univariate analysis, the&#xD;
      Student's t test will be used for the means and the chi2 test for nominal or ordinal&#xD;
      variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be evaluated 30 days after admission to the&#xD;
      hospital to assess mortality. The multivariate analysis of the variables that result&#xD;
      significant in the univariate analysis will be carried out by the Cox regression model in the&#xD;
      evaluation of mortality; the multivariate linear regression model for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      stay and the &quot;log rank&quot; model for the evaluation of admission to the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      (ICU) or the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). In addition, models will be developed to&#xD;
      estimate the effects of TDF treatment by regression adjustment for the primary outcomes of&#xD;
      this observational study: hospital stay, need for ICU (intensive care unit) and / or MV&#xD;
      (mechanical ventilation) and mortality. The Stata® software version 14 will be used and p&#xD;
      &lt;o.o5 will be considered significant.&#xD;
