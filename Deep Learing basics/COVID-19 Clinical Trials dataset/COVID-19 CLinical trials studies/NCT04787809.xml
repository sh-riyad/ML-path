  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety are frequently comorbid and share mechanisms contributing to&#xD;
      dysfunction. Transdiagnostic approaches, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy,&#xD;
      streamline intervention and allow a broader population to benefit in a cost-effective&#xD;
      fashion. Brief ACT interventions targeting at-risk individuals have the potential to prevent&#xD;
      negative outcomes. Delivering these in a digital format overcomes attitudinal and structural&#xD;
      barriers to accessing treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent psychological difficulties and&#xD;
      contribute to negative economic, social, and health outcomes. As they are frequently comorbid&#xD;
      and share underlying mechanisms of dysfunction, many scholars have conceptualized these as a&#xD;
      unified category of emotional disorders. Addressing processes contributing to dysfunction&#xD;
      among individuals who are at risk for developing emotional disorders has the potential to&#xD;
      prevent significant negative impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) has received empirical support in the treatment of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in a number of examinations. ACT aims to shape acceptance of&#xD;
      challenging thoughts and feelings and engagement with areas of life one finds meaningful and&#xD;
      important. The converse of acceptance, experiential avoidance, or the unwillingness to&#xD;
      experience unpleasant thoughts and emotions even when doing so is maladaptive, has been&#xD;
      predictive of symptoms of depression and anxiety. Reducing experiential avoidance and shaping&#xD;
      alternative responses, such as acceptance and behavior consistent with one's values, termed&#xD;
      committed action, is a promising strategy for targeting risk for emotional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional means of delivering interventions fail to reach a substantial proportion of those&#xD;
      who struggle with psychological difficulties. Barriers such as distance, time, and cost&#xD;
      contribute to these challenges. Digital mental health interventions offer a means to overcome&#xD;
      treatment barriers and increase access. These approaches can be delivered in individual's&#xD;
      homes at the time of their choosing. Additionally, digital interventions can be delivered to&#xD;
      many people at the same time, reducing cost. Support for the impact of ACT-informed digital&#xD;
      interventions on symptoms of depression and anxiety has been obtained, suggesting that this&#xD;
      framework is promising for reducing risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to compare the impact of a digital ACT-informed intervention&#xD;
      on psychological symptoms and processes of change among individuals at risk for depression&#xD;
      and anxiety. The following hypotheses will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Individuals in the treatment condition will experience a decrease in symptoms of&#xD;
           depression and anxiety compared to those in the control group&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individuals in the treatment condition will experience a decrease in experiential&#xD;
           avoidance and increase in values consistent behavior compared to those in the control&#xD;
           group&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The digital intervention will generally be rated positively&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The relationship between cognitive fusion and treatment response will be explored&#xD;
