      The objective of the National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) is to document the&#xD;
      nation's current supply of early care and education (ECE) services. Because the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic is likely to have had an impact on the ECE supply, and because the availability of&#xD;
      ECE services is critical to restoring the U.S. economy, updated data on the ECE supply will&#xD;
      be crucial for policy-making and research. The purpose of the NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Study&#xD;
      is to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pre-pandemic ECE supply and the ECE&#xD;
      workforce, including changes in supply or departures from and re-entries to the workforce.&#xD;
      Data from the study can be used to estimate the impact of the pandemic on ECE supply and the&#xD;
      financial health of ECE providers, as well as providers' experiences during and after the&#xD;
      pandemic emergency. Through a two-wave design, the NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Study data will&#xD;
      trace providers' and workforce members' experiences from 2019, through the initial months of&#xD;
      the pandemic (to be reported in the Wave 1 interview), and then to the one-year point since&#xD;
      the onset of the pandemic (to be reported in the Wave 2 interview). This design is intended&#xD;
      to capture the trajectories of providers and workforce members, for example through recovery&#xD;
      back to full or modified participation in ECE supply, or long-term exits from ECE supply.&#xD;
      Prospectively collecting these data allows inference about the types of providers and&#xD;
      workforce members most likely to have exited or survived in ECE, as well as the programmatic&#xD;
      supports received by those who remain in ECE at the time of the second interview.&#xD;

      The 2019 NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Study includes three surveys: 1) NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up&#xD;
      Home-based Provider Survey; 2) NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Center-based Provider Survey; and 3)&#xD;
      NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Center-based Workforce Survey. This study aims to collect data from&#xD;
      programs and individuals that completed interviews in the 2019 NSECE, regardless of whether&#xD;
      or not they are still providing ECE services at the time of the follow-up surveys, with some&#xD;
      exceptions (see Eligibility subsection below). The resulting data will document the&#xD;
      experiences of ECE providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a two-wave design, with surveys to be fielded in Fall 2020/Winter 2021 and&#xD;
      Spring 2021. Wave 1 of the study includes all providers that completed interviews in 2019.&#xD;
      For home-based providers and center-based workforce respondents, Wave 1 of the study will&#xD;
      collect data from the same individuals interviewed in 2019. For center-based providers, Wave&#xD;
      1 of the study will collect data from center directors interviewed in 2019 or, if they are&#xD;
      unavailable, other individuals knowledgeable about the center's operations. Wave 1 of the&#xD;
      study will collect data on whether providers were still providing ECE services in February&#xD;
      2020, that is, prior to the pandemic emergency. Providers or center-based workforce members&#xD;
      that had permanently ceased ECE services prior to February 2020 would not be fielded for Wave&#xD;
      2. Any providers or center-based workforce members who were participating in ECE provision at&#xD;
      the onset of the pandemic will be fielded for Wave 2, so that trajectories of ECE&#xD;
      participation, including temporary closures as well as permanent exits, can be identified in&#xD;
      the Wave 2 interview. We note that home-based provider survey respondents are both ECE&#xD;
      providers as well as members of the ECE workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Home-based Provider Survey. The purpose of this survey is to&#xD;
      understand home-based providers' practices and statuses since March 2020, as well as personal&#xD;
      impact on providers. The respondents for this survey include home-based providers who&#xD;
      participated in the 2019 NSECE and reported getting paid for their work looking after&#xD;
      children. The COVID-19 follow-up survey will ask home-based providers questions related to:&#xD;
      1) Employment Calendar (including the current status of the respondent's home-based program,&#xD;
      employment changes and gaps since February 2020, and wages received) ; 2) Experience of&#xD;
      Pandemic Assistance Programs (which will gather information about applications for program&#xD;
      assistance, assistance received, and sources of information the respondent used to learn&#xD;
      about child care and other types of assistance available); 3) ECE Practices during Reference&#xD;
      Period (such as exposure to COVID-19, special health practices, and staffing and enrollment&#xD;
      changes since March 2020/date of last interview); 4) ECE Status during Focal Week (covering&#xD;
      items about cost of care, comprehensive services, and characteristics of the children&#xD;
      enrolled during the last week of October 2020/April 2021); and 5) Current Personal&#xD;
      Information (consisting of questions related to the respondent's current financial health,&#xD;
      physical and mental health, household composition, and future ECE plans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Center-based Provider Survey. The purpose of this survey is to&#xD;
      understand center practices and statuses since March 2020. The respondents for this survey&#xD;
      include center-based providers who participated in the 2019 NSECE. The questionnaire will&#xD;
      collect information on five topics: 1) Care Status Calendar (including the current status of&#xD;
      the center-based organization, number of closures and openings since February 2020, reasons&#xD;
      for closing, and reasons or conditions for reopening); 2) Experience of Pandemic Assistance&#xD;
      Programs (applications for program assistance, assistance received, and sources of&#xD;
      information the respondent used to learn about providing child care during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic); 3) ECE Practices during Reference Period (including exposure to COVID-19, special&#xD;
      health practices, types of contact with children when closed); 4) ECE Status during Focal&#xD;
      Week (including items about cost of care, comprehensive services, program expenditures, and&#xD;
      characteristics of staff and enrolled children during the last week of October 2020/April&#xD;
      2021); and 5) Current Personal Information (questions about the respondent's future ECE plans&#xD;
      for themselves and for the organization as a whole).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSECE COVID-19 Follow-up Center-based workforce Survey. The purpose of this survey is to&#xD;
      understand ECE professional experiences and personal impact on ECE workers since March 2020.&#xD;
      Respondents for this survey will include center-based classroom staff who completed the 2019&#xD;
      Center-based workforce questionnaire. The survey will include five sections: 1) Calendar&#xD;
      (confirming employment status with center-based organization from 2019 NSECE); 2) Experience&#xD;
      of Pandemic Assistance Programs (incorporating questions about questions about the sources of&#xD;
      information the respondent used to learn about providing child care during and any special&#xD;
      situations they may have worked under the COVID-19 pandemic) ; 3) ECE Practices during&#xD;
      Reference Period (including information about any program exposure to COVID-19, special&#xD;
      health practices, types of contact with children when closed, and any professional&#xD;
      development activities during the pandemic); 4) ECE Status during Focal Week (information on&#xD;
      the groups of children the respondent works with, child care activities planned, job stress,&#xD;
      and center-based organizational support during the last week of October 2020/April 2021) ;&#xD;
      and 5) Current Personal Information (asks questions about respondent's current financial&#xD;
      health, physical and mental health, household composition, and future ECE plans).&#xD;
