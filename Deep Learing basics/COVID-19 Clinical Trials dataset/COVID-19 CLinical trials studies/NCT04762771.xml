      This is an open-label unblinded, randomized study to treat hospitalized covid-19 patients&#xD;
      with colchicine plus current care (per institution treating physicians) vs. current care per&#xD;
      institution treating physicians alone (the control arm)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      We aim to determine if Colchicine improves short-term outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19&#xD;
      patients with cardiac manifestations of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial injury has been described in up to 30% of COVID-19 infected patients, and portends&#xD;
      a poor prognosis with currently no known treatment. Colchicine is a widely available,&#xD;
      well-established, inexpensive, oral anti-inflammatory agent that has been FDA approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of inflammatory disorders including gout and familial Mediterranean Fever.&#xD;
      Trials have also shown its benefit to prevent post-cardiotomy syndrome, to treat acute and&#xD;
      recurrent pericarditis, and reduce cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. We&#xD;
      extrapolate based on these indications and studies that colchicine may also help improve&#xD;
      outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with evidence of cardiac injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an unblinded randomized study to treat hospitalized covid-19 patients with colchicine&#xD;
      plus current care per institution treating physicians vs. current care per institution&#xD;
      treating physicians alone (the control arm)&#xD;

    Recovery Trial showed no convincing evidence that further recruitment would provide conclusive&#xD;
    proof of worthwhile benefit for the evaluation of Colchicine in patients with Covid-19.&#xD;
