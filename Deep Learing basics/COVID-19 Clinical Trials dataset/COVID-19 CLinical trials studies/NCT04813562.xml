      This is a phase Ⅱ, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (CHO cells) in the&#xD;
      subjects from healthy adults and elderly adults aged 18 years and above (aged 18-60 and 60-85&#xD;
      years) . The phase Ⅱ clinical trials designed 4 research group, including an immunization&#xD;
      procedures (0, 28, 56 days), two doses (20μg/0.5ml, 40μg/0.5ml) and two ages group (adults&#xD;
      and elder): Each group including 120 participants. Vaccination or placebo group will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive in a 5:1 ratio, 480 in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cellular immune blood samples were collected from the top 96 subjects (i.e., the top 24 in&#xD;
      each study group, vaccine group: control group =5:1), and Elispot test and cytokine staining&#xD;
      (ICS)/flow assay were performed.&#xD;
