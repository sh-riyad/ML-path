  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has completely changed societal activity, including physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendations for wearing masks vary from country to country, region to region, and may be&#xD;
      mandatory or optional in indoor or outdoor environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During physical activities, the latest ministerial recommendations are that wearing a mask is&#xD;
      not mandatory even in case of close distance of less than one meter and in case of physical&#xD;
      contact (ministerial recommendations of September 19, 2020), even in regions where wearing a&#xD;
      mask is mandatory outdoors. This is based on elements not explained by the Ministry of Sports&#xD;
      and partly on elements showing a limitation of respiratory capacities during exercise tests&#xD;
      with gas exchange measurements. Indeed, subjects with FFP2 masks have their maximal capacity&#xD;
      to effort and VO2max decreased as well as the respiratory capacities whether at rest or&#xD;
      during effort in comparison with subjects without mask and to a lesser degree with surgical&#xD;
      masks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the FFP2 mask is not recommended by the medical or sports authorities, and surgical&#xD;
      or general public masks are recommended. Moreover, during leisure time physical activities,&#xD;
      it is not frequent that the subjects need to be at their maximum physical capacity. This&#xD;
      moderate loss of physical capacity at the peak of the effort is for most amateur athletes not&#xD;
      relevant in their practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, airborne transmission of COVID-19 has been shown in several studies: in a choir,&#xD;
      on a commercial airplane, on a bus, and close contact is a secondary source of contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is concern that physical activity in non-open environments is becoming a source of&#xD;
      COVID-19 contamination. In studies in non-open environments (bus, church, airplane), the&#xD;
      degree of contamination in a so-called confined atmosphere varies between 35 and 85%. In&#xD;
      Miller's study, in a church choir with a distance of 0.75 m between choristers and 1.4 m&#xD;
      between each row, after 2.5 hours of rehearsal including breaks and buffet, without wearing a&#xD;
      mask and with social distancing, hand washing with a hydro-alcoholic solution and reduction&#xD;
      of contacts, the contamination with a single patient was 85% on a total of 61 choristers. One&#xD;
      can imagine what the degree of contamination would be during a physical activity in a&#xD;
      gymnasium without wearing a mask, even with hand and foot washing and floor decontamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, all sports activities are stopped but they will start again sooner or later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the recontainment, according to the directives of the Ministry of Sports, the wearing&#xD;
      of masks was not compulsory and it was not recommended in outdoor activities (golf...) and in&#xD;
      gymnasiums including activities with contact (judo, dance...). Many people are reluctant to&#xD;
      wear a mask during sports activities: discomfort, fear of loss of performance, hypoxia...&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it seems essential to us to determine, during a physical activity, what are the&#xD;
      cardiac and respiratory consequences of wearing a surgical or general public mask, before&#xD;
      resuming sports activities in a few weeks or months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seems important to us to determine the degree of deterioration of the cardiac and&#xD;
      pulmonary physical capacities during physical leisure activities which concern more than 99%&#xD;
      of the leisure activities as opposed to the sports activities practised by professionals,&#xD;
      this to enlighten the practitioners and the ministerial authorities on the possible&#xD;
      non-deterioration of the physical capacities with the effort and the absence of deleterious&#xD;
      effect of the wearing of a mask.&#xD;

    <description>The sequence of mask wearing will be done by drawing lots, in double blind. Only the nurse will be informed of the mask sequence. The doctor will take measurements without seeing the type of mask placed between the athlete's face and the VO2 mask.&#xD;
The patient will not know which mask will be applied. He will have been informed that he will test three masks (a so-called high-tech mask which will in fact be without a mask, a surgical mask and a general public mask). When the mask is put on, the athlete's eyes will be closed, the sequence without a mask, presented to the subject as a high-tech mask, will be done with a mask that will be put on like a surgical mask or a mask for the general public, except that it will be hollowed out in its center.&#xD;
The effort tests will be done on a carpet with a filter called COVID on the VO2 masks.</description>
