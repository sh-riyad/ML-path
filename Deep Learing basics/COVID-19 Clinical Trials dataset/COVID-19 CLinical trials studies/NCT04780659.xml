  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open, non-randomized, phase IV cohort study in which the mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine Comirnaty will be given in two doses. Analyses will be performed on blood and saliva,&#xD;
      investigating humoral and cellular vaccine responses. Occurence of local or systemic&#xD;
      reactogenicity will be evaluated, as well as adverse events. The study will include persons&#xD;
      with primary or secondary immunosuppressive disorders, as well as immunocompetent persons,&#xD;
      with the aim of investigating if the immune responses after given Comirnaty mRNA vaccine&#xD;
      against COVID-19.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this study with 450 patients with primary or secondary immunosuppressive disorders&#xD;
      (patients with primary immunodeficiency, HIV infected patients, patients with allogenic stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation/CAR T cell treated, solid organ transplanted, and patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphatic leukemia) from Karolinska University Hospital, and healthy controls of 90&#xD;
      individuals for comparison, we will investigate the safety and the immune responses after&#xD;
      mRNA vaccination with Comirnaty after two doses, under 6 months of time for each participant.&#xD;
      The study is In collaboration with research groups at Karolinska Institutet and SciLifeLab,&#xD;
      with planned in-depth detailed analyses of antibody responses as well as cellular responses.&#xD;
      The study has obtained permission from Swedish Medical Agency and Swedish Ethical Review&#xD;
      Authority.&#xD;
