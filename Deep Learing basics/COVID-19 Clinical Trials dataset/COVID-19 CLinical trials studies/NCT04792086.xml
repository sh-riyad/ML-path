      This study will examine which impact lockdown strategies intending to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      COVID-19 had on people with cognitive impairment and dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive data from two large health studies in Norway, conducted before and after the&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak, will be linked with health register data on the use of health care&#xD;
      services and medication. Further, it will be conducted a survey addressing questions on&#xD;
      social isolation and use of communicative technology, from March 2020 to January 2021. The&#xD;
      knowledge gained from this study can improve the health care system's ability to respond more&#xD;
      adequately to pandemics and other unforeseen events, so that the negative consequences for&#xD;
      older adults with dementia and cognitive impairment can be reduced.&#xD;

      Introduction: To prevent the spread of COVID-19 societies around the world have implemented&#xD;
      various levels of lockdown strategies. Norway locked down major parts of the society from&#xD;
      March 2020. Specifically, this meant that public services were closed (e.g. most in-home&#xD;
      healthcare services, day care centres, group exercise/gyms and services that offer&#xD;
      physiotherapy, medical and psychological consultation). For people with cognitive impairment&#xD;
      and dementia, social distancing and self-isolation may have limited the use of normal&#xD;
      strategies (e.g., distraction, stimulation, and social interaction) that are routinely&#xD;
      adopted to manage some of the dementia symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms. A lack of&#xD;
      daily routines may change the clinical conditions of patients with dementia. Worsening of&#xD;
      preexisting and/or the onset of new neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur, in addition to a&#xD;
      possible decline of cognitive and functional capacities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The overarching aim of this project is to provide decision makers with vital information&#xD;
      to improve the healthcare of people with dementia and cognitive impairment in the context of&#xD;
      an epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: We will use four data sources:1) The fourth wave of the Trøndelag Health study (HUNT,&#xD;
      HUNT4 70+), 2) Three national health registries (The Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR), the&#xD;
      Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (NRPHC) and the Norwegian Prescription Database&#xD;
      (NorPD)), 3) A postal questionnaire concerning social isolation during the COVID-19 epidemic,&#xD;
      and 4) The Ageing in Trøndelag study (AiT), which is a follow-up of the HUNT4 70+ study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this linkage of cohort data and national health registry data, we can identify factors&#xD;
      that may make people with cognitive impairment and dementia vulnerable to loss of healthcare&#xD;
      services because of COVID-19 and subsequently to negative health consequences.&#xD;
