  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is a virus that emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019,&#xD;
      spread all over the world in a short time and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome and&#xD;
      pneumonia. The World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 outbreak as an&#xD;
      &quot;international public health emergency&quot; on January 30 and declared a global epidemic&#xD;
      (pandemic) on March 11, 2020, due to the rapid spread of the virus all over the world. speed&#xD;
      in the number of cases and deaths. Covidien-19 first cases were reported in Turkey on 10&#xD;
      March 2020 and the number of cases has risen steadily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of COVID-19 cases worldwide on 31.01.2021; It was reported to be 101,917,147&#xD;
      and the total number of deaths was 2,205,515 (https://covid19.who.int/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that the number of cases is constantly increasing, it is obvious that hospitals&#xD;
      will not meet the entire epidemic burden. During this period, home care has emerged as an&#xD;
      alternative way to effectively alleviate the epidemic burden. Home healthcare during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic; Four roles have stood out: home diagnosis, follow-up, treatment, and care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protective measures for home isolation of Covid-19 patients are the current method used to&#xD;
      prevent the spread of cases. Possible or definite cases that do not have an indication for&#xD;
      hospitalization, have a mild clinic and do not accompany severe chronic disease that may lead&#xD;
      to a severe course of covid-19 are followed at home until their symptoms improve. In&#xD;
      addition, patients who are hospitalized and meet discharge criteria can complete their&#xD;
      recovery processes at home. Isolation is terminated on the 14th day at the earliest following&#xD;
      the improvement of symptoms in patients who are followed at home. Reducing the contact of&#xD;
      people, isolating certain and suspicious cases and effective use of personal protective&#xD;
      equipment play an important role in combating the epidemic. It is thought that the training&#xD;
      that COVID-19 cases to be followed up and treated at home will be effective in drug&#xD;
      compliance, symptom management and quality of life will be effective in the management of the&#xD;
      disease. According to the results of the PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test and Thorax CT&#xD;
      (Thorax computed tomography) test performed by the Zonguldak Provincial Health Directorate&#xD;
      Public Health Directorate and by the radiation teams, U07.3 (Covid-19 laboratory test&#xD;
      positive), J12.9 (Viral Pneumonia, Undefined-Covid-19 laboratory test negative and diagnosed&#xD;
      according to Thorax CT result) and J12.8 (Patients diagnosed with Viral Pneumonia-Covid-19&#xD;
      laboratory test negative and Thorax CT result) diagnosed with ICD coded Covid-19 and&#xD;
      Zonguldak Public It is planned to create patients who are recommended to be followed up and&#xD;
      treated at home by the Presidency of Health.&#xD;

      G power analysis program was used to determine the sample size. The research will be&#xD;
      conducted with two groups, one intervention group and one control group. With professional&#xD;
      support in calculating the sample size of the study, the sample size was found to be 128 (64&#xD;
      intervention, 64 control), calculated at a 5% margin of error and a 95% confidence interval.&#xD;
      Participants who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups.&#xD;
