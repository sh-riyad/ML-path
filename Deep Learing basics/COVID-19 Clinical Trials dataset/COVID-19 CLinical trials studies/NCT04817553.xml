  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 124 million people worldwide as&#xD;
      of 23/3/2021. While studies on the outcomes of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (an important&#xD;
      gastroenterological disease requiring immunosuppressive therapies for treatment) patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 have been published recently, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes and management of IgG4 related disease patients with pancreatobiliary&#xD;
      involvement. Because the number of IgG4 patients with pancreatobiliary involvement cared by&#xD;
      individual centers and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection in different geographical regions&#xD;
      vary, we propose to conduct a multicenter retrospective study to further evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of COVID-19 on the clinical outcomes and management of IgG4 related disease patients with&#xD;
      pancreatobiliary involvement.&#xD;

      Since December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected more than 124 million people worldwide as&#xD;
      of 23/3/2021. While many COVID-19 patients have been reported to have a milder clinical&#xD;
      course, old age and comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, chronic lung conditions,&#xD;
      obesity, and diabetes have been associated with a more severe disease course and higher&#xD;
      mortality. Moreover, patients with chronic immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are at risk&#xD;
      of viral infections either related to their underlying immune dysfunction or the&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy that they receive for the chronic inflammatory conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IgG4 related disease is an increasingly recognized immune-mediated condition that may&#xD;
      resemble many malignant, infectious or inflammatory diseases. It is characterized by&#xD;
      tumor-like lesions, with histopathological features of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in&#xD;
      IgG4-positive plasma cells, obliterative phlebitis, storiform fibrosis, and, often but not&#xD;
      always, elevated serum IgG4 concentrations.&#xD;
