  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complex functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) with co-occurring anxiety are highly&#xD;
      prevalent in children, can be very disabling, and are not responsive to currently available&#xD;
      treatments. This research aims to better understand the neural mechanisms involved in a&#xD;
      promising nonpharmacological treatment for FAPD to ultimately guide the development of more&#xD;
      targeted treatment approaches for afflicted youth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPD) are among the most common chronic pain conditions&#xD;
      of childhood and are associated with significant functional disability, pain, and comorbid&#xD;
      anxiety that adversely impacts treatment outcomes. Thus, the PI developed a psychological&#xD;
      intervention, Aim to Decrease Anxiety and Pain Treatment (ADAPT; F32HD078049), that targets&#xD;
      both pain and anxiety using cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness meditation&#xD;
      approaches to improve patient outcomes. Preliminary testing has shown that ADAPT reduces pain&#xD;
      and anxiety in youth with FAPD. In this study, brain mechanisms implicated in the modulation&#xD;
      of pain and response to ADAPT will be investigated. Participants with FAPD and comorbid&#xD;
      anxiety will be randomized to either ADAPT or a waitlist control (each condition will last&#xD;
      for approximately 6 weeks). Participants will undergo fMRIs to explore changes in functional&#xD;
      connectivity and regional brain activation during visceral pain induction (via the water load&#xD;
      symptom provocation task; WL-SPT). In Aim 1, functional connectivity patterns associated with&#xD;
      a subjective response to pain induction in youth with FAPD who receive ADAPT will be compared&#xD;
      to the waitlist control. Conventional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI will be&#xD;
      used to assess functional connectivity to capture moment-to-moment fluctuations in activity.&#xD;
      In Aim 2, changes in regional brain activation for those receiving ADAPT will be compared to&#xD;
      those in the waitlist condition. The novel arterial spin label (ASL) MRI technique will be&#xD;
      used to gain inferences into regional brain activity. In line with the NCCIH funding&#xD;
      priorities, this study seeks to increase understanding of the mechanisms through which mind&#xD;
      and body approaches impact clinical outcomes in chronic pain and anxiety. Results will&#xD;
      advance the field by providing crucial information needed for the refinement and testing of a&#xD;
      tailored mind body intervention for FAPD and comorbid anxiety.&#xD;
