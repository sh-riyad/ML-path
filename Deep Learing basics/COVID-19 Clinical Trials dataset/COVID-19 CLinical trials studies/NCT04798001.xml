  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an investigational vaccine that is designed to protect humans against&#xD;
      infection with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19 disease. The&#xD;
      investigational vaccine, MV-014-212, is a live attenuated vaccine against respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus (RSV) that is expressing the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. MV-014-212 is&#xD;
      administered as drops or a spray in the nose. Specifically, this study analyzes the safety&#xD;
      of, and the immune response to, the vaccine when administered to healthy adults between the&#xD;
      ages of 18 and 69 years who are seronegative to SARS-CoV-2 and have not received a prior&#xD;
      vaccine against COVID-19.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study evaluates 3 dosages of MV-014-212 in healthy adults.&#xD;
Cohort A (18-55 years, inclusive) enrolls first. The first 10 participants (Group 1) receive Dosage 1. After Group 1 safety data review, 20 participants (Group 2) receive Dosage 2. After Group 2 safety data review, 50 participants (Group 3) receive Dosage 3: (i) 20 participants (Group 3a) receive a single dose; (ii) 10 participants (Group 3a) receive a 1st dose followed 2nd dose approx. 35 days after the 1st dose; (iii) 20 participants (Group 3b) receive a single dose by nasal atomizer (spray).&#xD;
After review of Cohort A safety data, Cohort B (56-69 years, inclusive) enrolls. Sequential enrollment into Group 4 (10 participants; Dosage 1), Group 5 (20 participants; Dosage 2), then Group 6 (20 participants; Dosage 3) is based in each case on the preceding safety data review, as for Cohort A.&#xD;
Within each group, a sentinel dosing approach is implemented as an added safety measure.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Solicited adverse events (AEs)</measure>

    <description>Frequency of solicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Solicited AEs are predefined AEs that may occur after investigational vaccine administration.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Unsolicited AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-vaccination period</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of unsolicited AEs will be measured, categorized by severity. Unsolicited AEs are any untoward medical occurrences in a participant administered the investigational vaccine, regardless of causal relationship to the investigational vaccine. Unsolicited AEs can include unfavorable and unintended signs (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or diseases temporally associated with the use of the investigational vaccine.</description>

    <measure>Serious adverse events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of SAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. SAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, that threaten life or result in any of the following: death, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <measure>Medically attended adverse events (MAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Full study duration, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency of MAEs will be measured, categorized by vaccine-relatedness. MAEs are AEs, whether considered causally related to the investigational vaccine or not, with unscheduled medically attended visits, such as urgent care visits, acute primary care visits, emergency department visits, or other previously unplanned visits to a medical provider. Scheduled medical visits such as routine physicals, wellness checks, 'check-ups', and vaccinations, are not considered MAEs.</description>
