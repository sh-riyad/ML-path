  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancers and diabetes, and it has been&#xD;
      a leading risk factor for death globally. Despite the availability of smoking cessation&#xD;
      services locally, most smokers do not use such services. Workplace is one of the most&#xD;
      convenient platforms to provide smoking cessation services and over 55% of smokers are&#xD;
      employed according to the local population-based survey. Moreover, The COVID-19 pandemic and&#xD;
      new normal increase in mental health burden to people in the workplace. An online survey&#xD;
      during the pandemic found 88% of Hong Kong employees suffered from stress at work during the&#xD;
      past 7 days. Mental health can be both precursors and consequences of smoking. However, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a smoking cessation programme conducted in workplace is yet to be examined&#xD;
      in Hong Kong, and the mental health support for smoking employees in promoting smoking&#xD;
      cessation is not clear. Thus, this study aims to test, by a 2-arm RCT, the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an intervention of which includes mobile phone-based intervention on reducing mental health&#xD;
      symptoms and smoking cessation in workplaces in Hong Kong; identify facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      of successful policy implementation and quitting; examine and evaluate the company&#xD;
      environment and their policies in promoting smoking cessation.&#xD;

      This study will separate into two phases. Phase I is a large scale cross-sectional survey of&#xD;
      corporations in Hong Kong to examine the employers' knowledge, attitudes and practices in&#xD;
      promoting SC in the workplace. Phase II is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial that will be&#xD;
      conducted to examine the effectiveness of mobile phone-based intervention combined with&#xD;
      company health talk, brief phone counselling and nicotine replacement therapy sampling, for&#xD;
      SC in workplaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the (1) profile of the corporations, including&#xD;
      the total number of employees and smoking employees; (2) employers/managerial staff's&#xD;
      knowledge on smoking; (3) employers/managerial staff's attitudes on smoking cessation; (4)&#xD;
      practices of the companies with respect to smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome is self-reported abstinence in the past 7 days at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes for smoking cessation include self-reported abstinence in the past 7 days&#xD;
      at 9- and 12-month follow-ups, the biochemically validated abstinence (defined as exhaled CO&#xD;
      level &lt;4ppm and saliva cotinine level ≤30 ng/ml); smoking reduction (50% or above reduction&#xD;
      in cigarette consumption compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes for mental health include&#xD;
      stress (Perceived Stress Scale-10), depression (Personal Health Questionnaire for&#xD;
      Depression), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), self-rated health, and quality of&#xD;
      life (EQ-5D-5L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, and mean will be used to summarize the&#xD;
      outcomes and other variables. Chi-square tests and t-tests will be used to compare outcome&#xD;
      variables between subgroups. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis will be used such that&#xD;
      those lost to contact and refused cases at the follow-ups will be treated as no reduction in&#xD;
      cigarette consumption nor quitting. Multiple imputations will be used to compute missing data&#xD;
      for outcome variables. The association between intervention adherence (e.g., engagement in&#xD;
      the IM interaction) and the primary outcome within the participants in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be examined. The intervention effect by subgroups will be assessed respectively,&#xD;
      including sex, age, education level, company types, previous quit attempts, cigarette&#xD;
      dependence, and intention to quit, although the statistical power would be lower due to&#xD;
      smaller numbers.&#xD;

    <description>Stress will be assessed by Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4). It reports perceived stress in the past month on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often). Individual scores on the PSS can range from 0 to 16 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress.</description>

    <time_frame>6-, 9-, and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed by Personal Health Questionnaire for Depression-2 (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 inquires about the frequency of depressed mood and anhedonia over the past two weeks. A PHQ-2 score ranges from 0-6. If the score is 3 or greater, major depressive disorder is likely.</description>

    <description>Self-rated health will be measured as a single-item with the response items &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;very good,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor.&quot;</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>6-, 9-, and 12-month</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L). The EQ-5D-5L has five domain scales (mobility, selfcare, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression) and five levels for each domain. Each digit in the five digit codes refers to the status of each dimension, ranging from 1 for no problem, to 5 for severe problem. For example, the five digit of '11111' implies to a health status with no problems in the 5 dimensions, scoring 1 being the best score with no problem in each domain listed in the order of: mobility= 1, self-care =1, usual activities =1, pain and discomfort=1, anxiety and depression =1. A higher score in the EQ-5D-5L indicated better health-related quality of life.</description>
