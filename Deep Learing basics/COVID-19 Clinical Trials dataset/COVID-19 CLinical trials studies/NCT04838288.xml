  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess cognitive outcome and quality of life in stable renal&#xD;
      transplant patients treated with twice daily tacrolimus at baseline and after switching to&#xD;
      Envarsus XL. The study is designed to see if switching patients from Tacrolimus to Envarsus&#xD;
      treatment improves cognitive function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease most commonly show cognitive impairments involving&#xD;
      attention, memory, executive functions, and mental processing speed. Although data have&#xD;
      demonstrated improvements in cognition following kidney transplant and the reversibility of&#xD;
      the memory problems evidenced in dialysis, neurotoxicity in transplant patients occurs in&#xD;
      &gt;40-50% of the patients treated with tacrolimus. Attention and working memory impairment have&#xD;
      been observed in patients treated with sirolimus or tacrolimus, while cyclosporine-treated&#xD;
      patients demonstrated performance similar to that of healthy volunteer controls, which may&#xD;
      indicate that the cognitive deficit found was partly related to treatment. ENVARSUS XR is a&#xD;
      new FDA-approved formulation of tacrolimus. A hallmark difference between ENVARSUS XR and&#xD;
      other forms of once- and twice-daily tacrolimus products is the unique, proprietary MeltDose®&#xD;
      drug delivery technology (Veloxis Pharmaceuticals, Hørsholm, Denmark) which reduces&#xD;
      tacrolimus' particle size to a molecular level. The decreased surface area of the drug&#xD;
      particles results in complete absorption and increased bioavailability in a once-daily dosing&#xD;
      formulation. In stable kidney transplant patients, ENVARSUS XR pharmacokinetics are&#xD;
      characterized by a steadier and more consistent concentration time profile over 24 hours,&#xD;
      reduced peak and peak-to-trough fluctuations and similar exposure while benefiting from ~ 20%&#xD;
      less total daily dose than twice daily tacrolimus. This open-label, prospective phase&#xD;
      clinical trial is designed to evaluate whether switching patients from TAC-IR to ENVARSUS XR&#xD;
      treatment improves cognitive function.&#xD;
