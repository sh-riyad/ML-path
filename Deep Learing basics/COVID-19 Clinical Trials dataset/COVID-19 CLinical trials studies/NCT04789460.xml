  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 infection is effective in many countries and has caused pandemics. It is observed&#xD;
      that it affects patients in a wide spectrum in terms of their clinical features worldwide. It&#xD;
      is known that age, gender, and comorbidity play an important role in the course of the&#xD;
      disease. Although mortality rates vary from country to country, there is no clear information&#xD;
      due to the fact that the pandemic has not yet ended. In this study, the investigators planned&#xD;
      to examine the laboratory characteristics of patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of&#xD;
      Covid-19 and to investigate their relationship with mortality in Istanbul city which is the&#xD;
      most affected by the pandemic in Turkey&#xD;
