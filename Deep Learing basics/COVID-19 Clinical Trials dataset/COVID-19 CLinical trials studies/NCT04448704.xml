  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on&#xD;
      international migrant workers by (1) documenting mental health symptoms among migrant workers&#xD;
      and (2) identifying risk and protective factors during the pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, there are an estimated 164 million migrant workers. Although studies have&#xD;
      documented how migrant workers have an increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes,&#xD;
      little is known about their mental health burden during a large-scale health crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current COVID-19 outbreak, migrant workers represent 9 in 10 of the COVID-19 cases in&#xD;
      Singapore, with 25 dormitories gazetted to contain the spread of the virus. Correspondingly,&#xD;
      these measures have placed a spotlight on the mental well-being of migrant workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research protocol, the investigators propose to administer a survey to understand the&#xD;
      prevalence and predictors of mental health symptoms amongst migrant workers in Singapore. In&#xD;
      particular, prior meta-analyses have identified COVID-19 health concerns, quarantine status,&#xD;
      financial instability, exposure to news and misinformation and demographics (i.e., gender,&#xD;
      age, education) as risk factors for poor mental health amongst the general population. By&#xD;
      assessing these factors amongst the migrant worker population and documenting their impact on&#xD;
      migrant workers' mental health, we hope to identify workers in greatest need of support&#xD;
      during the ongoing pandemic and provide empirical evidence to guide public health policies.&#xD;
