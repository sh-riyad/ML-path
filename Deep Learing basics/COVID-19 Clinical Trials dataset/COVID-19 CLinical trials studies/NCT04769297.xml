      A retrospective chart review of an open-label trial of low-dose ketamine administered to&#xD;
      front-line Healthcare workers who were identified as experiencing acute stress disorder due&#xD;
      to the COVID-19 Pandemic.&#xD;

      An investigation of a novel, off-label use of an FDA approved drug (ketamine) in a low(micro)&#xD;
      dose sublingual formulation of ketamine provided to front-line healthcare workers who were&#xD;
      identified as suffering from acute stress disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was conducted completely virtually via real-time telemedicine for physician visits&#xD;
      and via asynchronous interaction for outcomes data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients self-referred to the study via email outreach, and diagnosis was confirmed by&#xD;
      medically validated screening assessments and study physician confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once treatment was initiated, patients were seen via live telemedicine every 40 days while&#xD;
      treatment response/outcomes data was collected weekly and monthly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were treated up to 120 days.&#xD;
