    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled clinical trial examines the effectiveness of a face-to-face*&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral behavioral treatment to quit smoking enriched with an App. This project&#xD;
      aims to innovate in the psychological smoking cessation treatment and increase abstinence&#xD;
      rates in the short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Due to the COVID-19 the face-to-face treatment will be conducted in an online format.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychological treatment (cognitive-behavioral) is a first-line smoking cessation treatment&#xD;
      that has proven its efficacy. However, it is necessary to continue investigating to improve&#xD;
      smoking outcomes as abstinence and reduce relapse rates. The use of information technologies&#xD;
      (ICTs) in the field of health has grown and developed significantly in recent years.&#xD;
      Specifically, mobile applications (Apps), aimed at different health-related aspects (mHealth&#xD;
      Apps), are a valuable resource. Its use, as a complement to the face-to-face treatment, could&#xD;
      help to increase motivation to quit smoking, treatment adherence, and therapeutic activities&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      mHealth Apps are becoming highly relevant due to their cost-effectiveness and the added&#xD;
      attractiveness for many users. Considering this context, the main aim of the present project&#xD;
      is to design and assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for smoking&#xD;
      cessation enriched with a Smartphone App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized clinical trial will be carried out with a sample of 270 treatment-seeking&#xD;
      smokers at the Smoking Cessation and Addictive Disorders Unit of the University of Santiago&#xD;
      de Compostela. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The experimental group (CBT + App), in which participants will receive a&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral treatment* to quit smoking along with an App with active&#xD;
           therapeutic components during the treatment and 12 months follow-ups period (n = 135)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The control group (CBT), in which participants will receive the same&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioral treatment* along with the use of a Control App (without active&#xD;
           components) during the treatment (n = 135).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that the combination of a cognitive-behavioral psychological treatment&#xD;
      to quit smoking and an App with active therapeutic components will obtain higher abstinence&#xD;
      rates at the end of treatment and the 12-month follow-up period, compared to the control&#xD;
      group&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Due to the COVID-19, the face-to-face cognitive-behavioral treatment will be conducted in&#xD;
      an online format&#xD;
