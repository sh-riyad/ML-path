      Patients going through an in vitro fertilization cycle will be asked to participate .&#xD;
      Patients will be asked for their COVID-19 exposure : post confirmed disease/post vaccine/not&#xD;
      exposed to disease or vaccine . Patients will provide the fluids which are not required ,&#xD;
      once fertilization process is completed. Patients will also provide 5ml blood sample by the&#xD;
      day of procedure. Anti COVID-19 immunoglobulin G type antibodies will be measured in all&#xD;
      samples . Data regarding age, date of infection/vaccine will be collected . Progesterone and&#xD;
      Estrogen will be measured in female patients' samples and Perlecan level will be measured in&#xD;
      follicular fluid.&#xD;

      Patients going through an in vitro fertilization cycle will be asked to participate .&#xD;
      Patients will be asked for their COVID-19 exposure : post confirmed disease/post vaccine/not&#xD;
      exposed to disease or vaccine . Patients will provide the fluids which are not required in&#xD;
      the day of egg retrieval : the follicular fluid remaining after isolation of the egg and&#xD;
      spermatic fluid only, if not utilized for fertilization. The fluids will be collected once&#xD;
      fertilization process is completed. Patients will also provide 5ml blood sample by the day of&#xD;
      procedure. Anti COVID-19 immunoglobulin G type antibodies will be measured in all samples .&#xD;
      Data regarding age, date of infection/vaccine will be collected as well as indication for&#xD;
      treatment, Estradiol level before the egg retrieval, number of eggs collected and the&#xD;
      triggering ovulation modality . Progesterone and Estrogen will be measured in female&#xD;
      patients' samples (follicular fluid and serum). Perlecan level will be measured in follicular&#xD;
      fluid.&#xD;
