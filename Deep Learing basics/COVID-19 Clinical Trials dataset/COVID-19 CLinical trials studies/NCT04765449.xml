  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpsse of this research is to assess the safety and effectiveness of a new experimental&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19 infection. While the infection and virus actually have different&#xD;
      names, for the purpose of this consent, we will refer to them both as COVID-19. Specifically,&#xD;
      this is the virus that has caused the pandemic that moved across the world in early 2020. You&#xD;
      are being offered this experimental treatment because you have tested positive for the&#xD;
      COVID-19 virus and have additional reasons to be considered at higher risk for a more serious&#xD;
      outcome compared to the average patient who develops this infection.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        •Have a documented active COVID-19 infection and one of the following high-risk criteria:&#xD;
        oAge &gt;= 70 (with or without previously identified comorbid conditions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        AND/OR any one of the following comorbid conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        oMalignancy receiving radiation or chemotherapy in the prior 12 months oChronic lung&#xD;
        disease such as asthma, COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension or cystic&#xD;
        fibrosis, requiring treatment beyond inhaled medications oHypertension either treated or&#xD;
        with evidence of need for treatment oCardiovascular disease requiring active medical&#xD;
        monitoring and care including heart failure, heart dysrhythmias, coronary artery disease,&#xD;
        congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension oHistory of ischemic&#xD;
        stroke oDiabetes (type 1, type 2, or gestational) requiring treatment with insulin or oral&#xD;
        hypoglycemics oChronic Kidney Disease (Hx of stage 3b or greater as defined by the National&#xD;
        Kidney Foundation) oChronic Liver Disease (Previously diagnosed with cirrhosis or&#xD;
        previously classified as having Pugh-Child class A-C liver disease) oObesity (BMI &gt;= 35)&#xD;
