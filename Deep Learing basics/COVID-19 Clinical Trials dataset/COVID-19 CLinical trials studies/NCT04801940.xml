    <textblock>
      HEAL-COVID is jointly Sponsored by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and&#xD;
      The University of Cambridge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute effects of COVID-19 are now well described. Evidence is emerging of serious&#xD;
      longer-term complications occurring in the convalescent phase of the illness in a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patientsÍ¾ particularly cardiovascular and pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ill-defined syndrome, &quot;Long COVID&quot; is likely to include a constellation of different&#xD;
      conditions traversing post-ICU syndromes, significant cardiopulmonary complications,&#xD;
      post-viral syndromes and exacerbations of underlying conditions. Patients have reported a&#xD;
      range of longer-term symptoms associated with Long COVID that have significant impacts on&#xD;
      their quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there has been little work evaluating treatments in the convalescent phase of&#xD;
      COVID-19. HEAL-COVID aims to evaluate the impact of treatments on longer-term morbidity,&#xD;
      mortality, re-hospitalisation, symptom burden and quality of life associated with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first two treatment arms are Apixaban and Atorvastatin, with further treatment arms to be&#xD;
      added at the direction of the UK COVID-19 Therapeutic Advisory Panel (UKCTAP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was&#xD;
      described in Wuhan, China. Named SARS-CoV-2 due to its resemblance to the coronavirus&#xD;
      responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), COVID-19 is the infectious&#xD;
      disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite historically unprecedented public health measures,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared&#xD;
      the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30th January&#xD;
      2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute effects of COVID-19 are now well described. Evidence is emerging of serious&#xD;
      longer-term complications occurring in the convalescent phase of the illness in a significant&#xD;
      proportion of patients. COVID-19 is a new disease, the natural history of which remains&#xD;
      uncertain. Recent data highlight that ~20% of patients develop new or worsened&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary symptoms at 40-60-days after hospital discharge. A unique feature of COVID-19&#xD;
      is the high incidence of these cardiovascular and pulmonary complications that may carry&#xD;
      long-term implications for morbidity and mortality including venous thromboembolism,&#xD;
      persistent lung inflammation, and pulmonary fibrosis; increasingly it appears these may not&#xD;
      be confined to the acute phase of the illness, but rather may also occur during the&#xD;
      convalescent phase of the illness, thus providing a major contribution to the ill-defined&#xD;
      syndrome &quot;Long COVID&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Long COVID&quot; is likely to include a constellation of different conditions traversing post-ICU&#xD;
      syndromes, significant cardiopulmonary complications, post-viral syndromes and exacerbations&#xD;
      of underlying conditions. Patients have reported a range of long-term symptoms associated&#xD;
      with Long COVID that have significant impact on their quality of life. Though there have been&#xD;
      effective acute treatments, there has been little work evaluating longer-term treatment aimed&#xD;
      at reducing longer-term complications. To investigate the role of medium-term convalescent&#xD;
      treatment targeting known and emerging complications, an adaptive platform trial will enrol&#xD;
      patients at the point of hospital discharge from across centres in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES: HEAL-COVID is an adaptive platform trial design to provide reliable evidence on&#xD;
      the efficacy of post-hospitalisation treatments to improve longer-term clinical outcomes from&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In early 2021, when the trial commenced, there were no treatments being assessed in&#xD;
      randomised controlled trials targeting the post-hospital phase of COVID-19. Longer-term&#xD;
      outcomes for COVID-19 are currently unclear, but early data suggest a significant burden of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity. In this situation, even treatments with only a moderate impact on&#xD;
      survival or on hospital resource use are worthwhile. Therefore, the focus of HEAL-COVID is&#xD;
      the impact of candidate treatments on mortality and the need for rehospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine whether interventions in the post-hospital&#xD;
      (convalescent) phase of COVID-19 improve longer-term mortality/morbidity outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of HEAL-COVID are to evaluate treatment-specific and patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes of COVID-19 and their response to intervention, as well as to estimate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY AND RANDOMISATION: The HEAL-COVID trial aims to recruit 877 patients per active&#xD;
      arm and an equal number of matched controls based on sample size calculations described&#xD;
      further in the publicly available trial protocol (www. heal-covid.net). All patients or a&#xD;
      representative must provide written, informed consent before any study procedures occur and&#xD;
      must meet all eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPTIVE DESIGN: New therapeutic arms will be commenced on the recommendation of the UK&#xD;
      COVID-19 Therapeutics Advisory Panel (UK-CTAP), in discussion with the Chief Medical Officer&#xD;
      for England, if approved by the Chief Investigator/Sponsor. New treatments will be added to&#xD;
      the platform by recruiting additional participants to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analyses will be undertaken once 181 events have been observed across both arms in&#xD;
      the comparison. The Independent Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) may recommend that&#xD;
      the treatment arms be discontinued for lack of benefit, or safety reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIMPLICITY OF PROCEDURES: To facilitate collaboration, even in hospitals that suddenly become&#xD;
      overloaded, patient enrolment (via a secure web-based randomisation and data capture system)&#xD;
      and all other trial procedures are greatly streamlined. Informed consent is simple and data&#xD;
      entry is minimal. Randomisation via the internet is simple and quick, at the end of which the&#xD;
      allocated treatment is displayed on the screen and can be printed or downloaded. Follow-up&#xD;
      information is collected via routinely collected data.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue Scale (FACIT-Fatigue) is a 13-item measure that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. It has been validated for use across a range of populations. The FACIT-Fatigue has a 7-day recall period and is scored on a 5-point Likert Scale from &quot;0-Not at all&quot;- to &quot;4-Very much&quot;. Individual items scores are summed (2 items of are reversed scored), multiplied by 13 and then divided by the number of items answered with a higher score indicating less fatigue and better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Modified MRC Dyspnoea Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale is a modification to the widely used MRC Dyspnoea scale. The item has a 24-hour recall period and is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;0 - I only get breathless with strenuous exercise&quot; to &quot;4 - I was breathless when dressing, talking or at rest&quot;. It is a new measure developed specifically for COVID-19 trials, but has a high degree of conceptual overlap with its parent clinical measure, the MRC Dyspnoea scale, which is in widescale clinical practice.</description>

    <measure>COVID-19 core outcome measure for recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The COVID-19 core outcome measure for recovery is a single item intending to measure a return to the pre-illness state. The item has a same day recall period and is scored on a 5-point Likert scale from &quot;0 - Completely recovered&quot; to &quot;5 - Not recovered at all&quot;. It is a new measure developed specifically for COVID-19 trials, but is similar to widely used global clinical impression scales common to many clinical trials.</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-2 is a screening tool for depression derived from the PHQ-9. It comprises the first 2 items of the PHQ-9 (depressed mood and anhedonia). The PHQ-2 has a recall period of 2 weeks. It has a global score (0-6, no weighting). A higher score indicates increased likeliness of underlying depressive disorder. The recommended cut-off score for further investigation is â¥ 3. The PHQ-2 has been validated in many studies and has shown sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 92%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (GAD-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-2 is a screening tool for generalised anxiety disorder derived from the GAD-7. It comprises the first 2 items of the GAD-7, which are considered as the core anxiety symptoms (&quot;feeling nervous, anxious or on edge&quot;/Not being able to stop or control worrying&quot;). The GAD-2 performs well as a screening tool for three other common anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and PTSD). It has a recall period of two weeks. The GAD-2 has a global score (0-6, no weighting). A higher score indicates increased likeliness of underlying anxiety disorder. The recommended cut-off score for further investigation is â¥ 3. The GAD-2 has been validated in many studies and has retained the same psychometrics properties of the GAD-7 (86% sensitivity/83% specificity).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PTSD Checklist (PCL-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCL-2 is an abbreviated version of the PTSD Checklist - Civilian version (PCL-C) and is used to screen people for PTSD. It comprises 2 items (intrusive memories/distress associated with reminders of the traumatic event). It has a recall period of one month. An individual is considered to have screened positive if the sum of these two items is â¥ 4. Previous studies have shown that the PCL-2 has good psychometric properties and have shown sensitivity of 0.97 and specificity of 0.58.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life using the EQ5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Euroqol EQ-5D-5L comprises 5 items plus 1 visual analogue scale. It has been widely validated across a range of diseases and used to assess health outcome from a wide variety of interventions on a common scale, for purposes of evaluation, allocation and monitoring. It is used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in health technology assessment. EQ-5D-5L, takes only a few minutes to complete and has a same day recall period. Utilities may be estimated from responses to the EQ-5D-5L, and applying the 3L cross-walk value set.</description>
