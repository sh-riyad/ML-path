    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2/3 study in healthy children &lt;12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dependent upon safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study,&#xD;
      and the resulting assessment of benefit-risk, the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      BNT162b2 in participants &lt;6 months of age may subsequently be evaluated.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 is the open-label dose-finding portion of the study to evaluate safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and immunogenicity of BNT162b2 on a 2-dose (separated by approximately 21 days) schedule in&#xD;
      up to 3 age groups (participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years, ≥2 to &lt;5 years, and ≥6 months to &lt;2 years&#xD;
      of age). Dose finding is being initiated in this study in participants ≥5 to &lt;12 years of age&#xD;
      based on the acceptable blinded safety assessment of the 30-μg dose in 12- to 15-year-olds in&#xD;
      the C4591001 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of Phase 1 is to identify preferred dose level(s) of BNT162b2 from up to 3&#xD;
      different dose levels in each age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2/3 will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in each age group at the&#xD;
      selected dose level from Phase 1. Efficacy will be evaluated across all age groups in which&#xD;
      immunobridging is successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number of cases across&#xD;
      those age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have blood drawn at baseline prior to Dose 1 and 6 months after Dose 2.&#xD;
      Immunobridging to participants 16 to 25 years of age in the C4591001 study will be based on&#xD;
      immunogenicity data collected at baseline and 1 month after Dose 2. The persistence of the&#xD;
      immune response will be based on immunogenicity data collected in participants at baseline&#xD;
      and at 1, 6, 12 (original BNT162b2 group only), and 24 months after Dose 2 (original BNT162b2&#xD;
      group only). In addition, efficacy against confirmed COVID-19 and against asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-month follow-up visit, all participants will be unblinded. Participants who&#xD;
      originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive BNT162b2 as part of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 450 participants (300 in the active vaccine group and 150 in the placebo group)&#xD;
      randomized in each age group in this phase will contribute to the immunobridging analysis at&#xD;
      1 month after Dose 2 and will contribute to the overall analysis of the persistence of immune&#xD;
      response at 6 months after Dose 2. These participants will be enrolled from both US and EU&#xD;
      sites to ensure this subset is representative of the whole study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the persistence time points of 12 and 24 months after Dose 2, approximately 70&#xD;
      participants from each age group in the original BNT162b2 vaccine group will have an&#xD;
      immunogenicity blood draw in order to contribute to the analysis. All approximately 4500&#xD;
      participants will contribute to the VE analysis for conditional VE and asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection. Efficacy will be evaluated across all age groups in which immunobridging is&#xD;
      successful, depending on accrual of a sufficient number of cases across those age groups.&#xD;
