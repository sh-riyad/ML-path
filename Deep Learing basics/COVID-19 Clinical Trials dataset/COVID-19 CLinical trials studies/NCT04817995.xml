      Intervention is going to take the form of an internet-based stress recovery intervention&#xD;
      consisting of six modules. The themes include introduction, psychological detachment,&#xD;
      distancing, mastery, control, and keeping the change alive. These themes were chosen after&#xD;
      considering topics that might be the most useful for healthcare staff experiencing high&#xD;
      levels of stress. Each module consists of psychoeducation and exercise parts. Psychologist&#xD;
      provide individual feedback on completed exercises as well as can be reached on demand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the intervention will be compared against a waiting list control group.&#xD;
      Intervention is in Lithuanian.&#xD;
