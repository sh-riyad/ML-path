  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is arguably the biggest challenge critical care medicine has been confronted with&#xD;
      since its conception. Critical care services around the world are flooded by patients&#xD;
      presenting with severe respiratory failure who require prolonged treatment in the ICU.&#xD;
      Despite the support provided, outcomes are poor, particularly in ventilated patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many unanswered questions remain regarding the pathophysiology of COVID-19, particularly in&#xD;
      severely ill patients. No evidence-based treatment is currently available, yet different&#xD;
      often experimental therapies are administered to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As experience grows, new phenotypes are recognized, and unreported complications are observed&#xD;
      in the most severely ill patients. Although many registries are currently including patients,&#xD;
      few of them focus on ICU patients and their specific treatments and newly observed&#xD;
      complications and challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the pandemic may appear on its return in many countries that are now easing the&#xD;
      restrictions that were put in place to limit the spread of the disease, it can be expected&#xD;
      that COVID-19 will be a continued challenge in ICUs globally until a safe and effective&#xD;
      vaccine is found. Efforts to study the disease should continue in order to advance our&#xD;
      understanding of the disease as well as improve treatment options.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, international, anonymized point prevalence study. Patients who were&#xD;
      present in the ICU on the day in April 2020 with the highest number of COVID-19 patients in&#xD;
      the unit. Data can be entered in the database until July 2020. Retrospective data collection&#xD;
      and entry is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects believed to fulfill all eligibility criteria, and none of the exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      detailed in the relevant section of this protocol, will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered in the database anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will consist of two core elements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Center data (to be completed once)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient data&#xD;
&#xD;
      For different domains with specific, highly relevant and un(der)explored ICU research&#xD;
      questions, an focused data set is to be completed. These domains include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Respiratory&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Coagulation and thrombo-embolic events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Infectious complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Rehabilitation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Renal&#xD;
