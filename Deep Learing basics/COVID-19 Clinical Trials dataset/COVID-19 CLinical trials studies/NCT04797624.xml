  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyze whether COVID-19 causes a delay in the diagnosis of&#xD;
      gastric cancer patients particularly in the TNM staging of the tumor, or not and to compare&#xD;
      the number of newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer before and during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study included the patients diagnosed with gastric cancer during the period between March&#xD;
      1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, in the pandemic group at the Adana City Training and Research&#xD;
      Hospital, Department of General Surgery, Divisions of Gastroenterological Surgery and&#xD;
      Surgical Oncology. For the baseline group, patients diagnosed with gastric cancer between&#xD;
      January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, was included in the same department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and pathological data of the patients were retrospectively collected from the&#xD;
      hospital medical records. The following parameters were compared between the pandemic and&#xD;
      baseline periods; age and gender distributions, mean monthly numbers of newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients, CEA and CEA-19.9 levels, the type of the surgery, the location of the tumor, the&#xD;
      frequency of the patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment, American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, length of the hospital stay, clinical staging and pathologic&#xD;
      TNM staging.&#xD;
