      This is a multicenter, single-treatment study. Subjects will consist of adults with COVID-19&#xD;
      associated acute lung injury who are being cared for in a critical care environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant that, in its liquid form (SURFAXIN®), is approved by&#xD;
      the United States Food and Drug Administration (NDA 021746) for the prevention of respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been studied in over 2000 children and adults. Preliminary data from animal and adult&#xD;
      human studies indicate that lucinactant may be able to benefit those with acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) in the context of COVID-19 infection, improving oxygenation and lung&#xD;
      compliance. When given to intubated patients, Lucinactant could potentially decrease the&#xD;
      duration of ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lucinactant has an extensive safety profile in different patient populations for different&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve the respiratory status of patients suffering&#xD;
      from COVID-19.&#xD;
