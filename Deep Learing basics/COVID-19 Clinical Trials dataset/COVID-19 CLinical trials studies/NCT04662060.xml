  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to efficiently evaluate the clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of different investigational therapeutics among adults who have COVID-19 but are not&#xD;
      yet sick enough to require hospitalization. The overall hypothesis is that through an&#xD;
      adaptive trial design, potential effective therapies (single and combination) may be&#xD;
      identified for this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 Outpatient Pragmatic Platform Study (COPPS) is a pragmatic platform protocol&#xD;
      designed to evaluate COVID-19 treatments by assessing their ability to reduce viral shedding&#xD;
      (Viral Domain) or improve clinical outcomes (Clinical Domain). To be included into the&#xD;
      platform, every investigational product will collect data for both Domain primary endpoints.&#xD;
      Individual treatments to be evaluated in the platform will be described in separate&#xD;
      sub-protocols.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The platform study allows investigational products with objectives either: evaluating viral&#xD;
      shedding (Virology Domain); and COVID-19 related Clinical Outcomes (Clinical Domain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for investigational products within the Viral Domain is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in addition to standard&#xD;
      supportive care (SSC) compared with SSC in reducing viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 virus in&#xD;
      outpatients with COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for investigational products within for the Clinical Domain is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in addition to SSC as compared&#xD;
      to SSC in improving sustained clinical outcomes in outpatients with COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The objective of the non-assigned domain an investigational product is under.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If under Clinical Domain, reduction in viral shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If under Viral Domain, time to resolution of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy of each therapeutic intervention in reducing SARS-CoV-2 related&#xD;
           hospitalizations, ED visits, or death in outpatients with COVID-19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the development of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of each therapeutic intervention compared with&#xD;
           placebo (supportive care).&#xD;
