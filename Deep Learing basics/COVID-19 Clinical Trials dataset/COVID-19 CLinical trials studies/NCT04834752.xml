  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study aims to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or&#xD;
      histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) on the clinical outcomes and positivity rates of&#xD;
      Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous researches on the association between the use of PPI and H2RA and the treatment and&#xD;
      prevention of COVID-19 have reported inconsistent findings. This study aimed to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors on the clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      positivity rates of COVID-19 using the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) data. This is a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study using the NHI COVID-19 dataset, which includes health insurance&#xD;
      data of individuals who underwent COVID-19 PCR test in South Korea. This study aims to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the use of PPI and H2RA on the positivity rates and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of COVID-19.&#xD;

        Individuals who were tested for COVID-19 using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay of&#xD;
        nasal and pharyngeal swabs were included. Data were obtained from the Korean national&#xD;
        health insurance claims-based database (COVID-19 research dataset). Individuals with a&#xD;
        Record of a new prescription of NSAID within 1 month of the test date were excluded because&#xD;
        NSAID users for early pneumonia symptoms may initiated for PPIs or H2 blockers.&#xD;
