  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last several years, distress among healthcare professionnals is well described, and&#xD;
      general practice residents are also affected. Because of COVID-19 sanitary crisis, stress&#xD;
      factors are increased, and that may cause anxiety, exhaustion, psychic distress, depression,&#xD;
      addictions, or post traumatic stress.&#xD;

      This prospective non-interventional study aims to evaluate via two questionnaires the&#xD;
      evolution of perceived stress in general practice residents of two centres in France, Rouen&#xD;
      and Caen. The two questionnaires contain the Perceived Stress Scale, as well as items&#xD;
      regarding socio-demographic data and stress factors. The first questionnaire is to be&#xD;
      distributed during the epidemic COVID-19 wave and the second questionnaire at the end of the&#xD;
      epidemic COVID-19 wave.&#xD;
