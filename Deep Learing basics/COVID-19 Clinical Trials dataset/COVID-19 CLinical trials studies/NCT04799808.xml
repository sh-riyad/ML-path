  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate short- (3 and 8 weeks) and long-term (6, 9, 12, and 18 months) immune&#xD;
      protection or response at the humoral and cellular levels before and after SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection or vaccination in patients with moderately reduced immune status (dialysis&#xD;
      patients) and severely reduced immune status (organ transplant recipients, mostly kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients) and immunocompetent subjects (medical staff) in Saxony, Germany.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Formation of two separate cohorts of approximately 1000 study subjects each from the&#xD;
           three categories (dialysis patients, solid organ transplant recipients and medical&#xD;
           staff) of participants vaccinated using either Biontech or Moderna vaccine (Biontech&#xD;
           cohort and Moderna cohort, approximately 2000 subjects total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study time points: Before administration of the 1st SARS-CoV-2 vaccine dose, before the&#xD;
           2nd vaccine dose, and 8 weeks and 6, 9, 12, and 18 months after administration of the&#xD;
           1st vaccine dose and after suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At all time points, a questionnaire or eCRF will be completed with questions about the&#xD;
           dialysis center and the clinical course of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Humoral immune response will be determined in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Formation of a study subgroup of up to 300 subjects in each cohort (Biontech or Moderna&#xD;
           cohort) for detailed evaluation of the cellular immune response (max. 600 subjects in&#xD;
           total).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of non-sustained immunity &gt; 6 months as well as the occurrence of a 3rd&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in autumn 2021, this will be investigated analogously to the&#xD;
           current wave.&#xD;
