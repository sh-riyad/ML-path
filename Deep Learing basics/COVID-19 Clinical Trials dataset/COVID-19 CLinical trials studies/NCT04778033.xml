  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will explore the effect of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine on&#xD;
      semen analysis parameters among 75 fertile men. Fertile men will be regarded as such if they&#xD;
      previously successfully impregnated their partners without the use of artificial reproductive&#xD;
      technology, or men who previously had a normal sperm analysis exam by WHO criteria (2010).&#xD;
      Those recruited will supply a single sperm sample 1-2 months following the second dose of the&#xD;
      vaccination. In addition, the participants will fill a brief questionnaire with information&#xD;
      regarding their medical and reproductive history. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      macroscopic and microscopic properties of the semen samples and compare them to the WHO semen&#xD;
      analysis reference range in an attempt to ascertain whether the vaccine influences sperm&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious respiratory tract&#xD;
      disease which was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in Dec 2019, but has since&#xD;
      spread globally. By march 2020 it was declared by WHO as a public health emergency pandemic&#xD;
      and has thus far affected tens of millions worldwide. The implications of COVID 19 infection&#xD;
      on male fertility were examined in a previous study, which found decreased sperm&#xD;
      concentration in recovering patients compared with controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newly available mRNA COVID 19 vaccine by Pfizer was recently evaluated in a large&#xD;
      multicenter placebo controlled RCT. The vaccine is comprised of BNT162b2, a lipid&#xD;
      nanoparticle formulated nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) encoding the SARS-CoV2 full length&#xD;
      spike protein, modified by two Proline mutations. The two 20 Âµg doses were shown to elicit&#xD;
      high SARS-COV2 neutralizing antibody titers alongside high antigen specific CD8+ and Th1 type&#xD;
      CD4+ T cell response. It was subsequently shown to be 95% effective in preventing COVID-19&#xD;
      infection a week following the second dose with a favorable safety profile in a 2-month&#xD;
      median following up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfounded claims in the popular media linked a possible correlation between the COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine and potential female\male infertility. Currently. there is no information in the&#xD;
      medical literature which examined semen analysis parameters following the COVD-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will explore the effect of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccine on&#xD;
      semen analysis parameters among 75 fertile men. Fertile men will be regarded as such if they&#xD;
      previously successfully impregnated their partners without the use of artificial reproductive&#xD;
      technology, or men who previously had a normal sperm analysis exam by WHO criteria (2010).&#xD;
      Those recruited will supply a single sperm sample 1-2 months following the second dose of the&#xD;
      vaccination. In addition, the participants will fill a brief questionnaire with information&#xD;
      regarding their medical and reproductive history. The investigators will examine the&#xD;
      macroscopic and microscopic properties of the semen samples and compare them to the WHO semen&#xD;
      analysis reference range in an attempt to ascertain whether the vaccine influences sperm&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
