      Grand Hôpital de Charleroi (GHdCà had to organize the vaccination of its staff in December&#xD;
      2021 against SARS-CoV-2.On the sidelines of this vaccination campaign, the management&#xD;
      committee agreed to document the knowledge of the SARS-Cov-2 serology of all the staff of the&#xD;
      establishment before this vaccination campaign, as well as a few weeks after vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Grand Hôpital de Charleroi (GHdC) staff were exposed to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      during the first half of 2020: a seroprevalence survey, conducted in the summer of 2020,&#xD;
      after the &quot;first wave&quot; of the epidemic, and before the &quot;second wave&quot;, thus revealed a&#xD;
      significant seroprevalence because of its exposure. This study, because of its high&#xD;
      participation rate, also showed the sustained interest of the agents in knowing their&#xD;
      serology, either for personal reasons, or for the purposes of recognition as an occupational&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GHdC decided in December 2020 to organize as soon as possible the vaccination of its&#xD;
      salaried and self-employed employees who wish to take advantage of this opportunity. On the&#xD;
      sidelines of this vaccination campaign, the management committee agreed to document the&#xD;
      knowledge of the SARS-Cov-2 serology of all the staff of the establishment before this&#xD;
      vaccination campaign, as well as a few weeks after vaccination. This knowledge must better&#xD;
      organize the disease prevention strategy, both with regard to the staff themselves and the&#xD;
      patients for whom they are called upon to treat.&#xD;

group 2: participant who has received his first dose of vaccine and who performs his serological test when he receives the second dose of vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 virus to determine his immunity.
