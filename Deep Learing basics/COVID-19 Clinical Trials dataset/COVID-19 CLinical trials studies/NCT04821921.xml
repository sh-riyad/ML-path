  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;CoDiaM study&quot; examines how diabetes management and outcomes are changing during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic and whether these changes are influenced by socio-demographic factors,&#xD;
      health literacy, self-efficacy and perceived social support.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 pandemic created new challenges for patients with diabetes and their treating&#xD;
      physicians. In order to protect people from SARS-COV-2 infections, social contacts were&#xD;
      reduced by restrictions on many areas of social life. As a side effect, these measures could&#xD;
      have also led to changes in the self-management of patients with diabetes mellitus, such as&#xD;
      lack of physical exercise, less healthy dietary behavior, and a reduced intensity of medical&#xD;
      care. These possible changes may be associated with poorer control of blood glucose,&#xD;
      cholesterol, and blood pressure. Therefore, the CoDiaM study will investigate how management&#xD;
      and outcomes of diabetes are changing during the pandemic and identify associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on data of patients treated in three GP practices specialized on diabetes&#xD;
      treatment in Hamburg, Germany. Data collection will include a written patient survey and&#xD;
      extraction of clinical data from patient records. The patient's survey includes&#xD;
      sociodemographic data and validated instruments to assess diabetes self-management (DSMQ),&#xD;
      health literacy (HLS-EU-Q16), self-efficacy (General Self-efficacy scale) and perceived&#xD;
      social support (F-SozU K14). Data will be analyzed by descriptive statistics and&#xD;
      multivariable, multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for possible&#xD;
      confounders and random effects on the practice level.&#xD;

        The study is located in Hamburg, Germany. Patients from three GP practices specialized on&#xD;
        diabetes treatment in Hamburg will be included. In each practice, eligible patients with&#xD;
        diabetes type 1 and 2 will receive patient information, consent form and questionnaire by&#xD;
        mail. After written informed consent and after the questionnaires have been returned, data&#xD;
        from patient records in the practices will be extracted. The investigators estimated that&#xD;
        approximately 3000 patients will be eligible to be contacted. From pretest and experience&#xD;
        with similar studies the investigators anticipated a response rate of 25% (=750 patients).&#xD;
