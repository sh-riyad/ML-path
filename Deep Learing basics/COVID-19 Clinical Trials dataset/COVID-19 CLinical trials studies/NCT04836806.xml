      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of cetirizine and famotidine in reducing the duration of symptoms in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
      Secondary aims are to determine if cetirizine and famotidine decrease severity and duration&#xD;
      of symptoms, incidence of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2). Patients with COVID-19 may present with a myriad of symptoms ranging from fever&#xD;
      and cough to more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath. Cetirizine and famotidine are&#xD;
      commonly administered medications that can be found over-the-counter. They are well tolerated&#xD;
      and have low potential for drug-drug interaction. With it's anti-inflammatory properties via&#xD;
      modulation of proinflammatory cytokines, cetirizine may be an effective symptomatic&#xD;
      therapeutic for COVID-19. With possible antiviral properties, famotidine may have a role in&#xD;
      therapy as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a positive COVID test has been confirmed, participants with be randomized to take&#xD;
      cetirizine and famotidine or a placebo for 10 days and the study medication will be shipped&#xD;
      to them. Participants will record their symptoms for 30 days and any serious adverse events&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 60 days.&#xD;
