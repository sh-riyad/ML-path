  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral respiratory illness caused by the severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may predispose patients to thrombotic&#xD;
      disease due to a state of profound inflammation, platelet activation, and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction leading to respiratory distress and increased mortality. The incidence of&#xD;
      macrovascular thrombotic events varies from 10 to 30% in COVID-19 hospitalized patients&#xD;
      depending on the type of arterial or vein thrombosis captured and severity of illness .&#xD;
      Observational results in patients receiving routine low-dose prophylactic anticoagulation&#xD;
      (LD-PA), several institutions have recently released guidance statement to prevent&#xD;
      macrovascular thrombotic events with dose escalation anticoagulation. In these&#xD;
      recommendations, high-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (HD-PA) and therapeutic&#xD;
      anticoagulation (TA) can be employed either empirically or based on the body mass index and&#xD;
      increased D-dimer values. No randomized trial has validated this approach, and other recent&#xD;
      recommendations challenge this approach. Microvascular thrombotic events are also of major&#xD;
      concern in critically ill patients with COVID-19, even in the absence of obvious&#xD;
      macrovascular thrombotic events. A large review of autopsy findings in COVID-19-related&#xD;
      deaths reported micro thrombi in small pulmonary vessels. More generally, COVID-19-induced&#xD;
      endothelitis and coagulopathy across vascular beds of different organs lead to widespread&#xD;
      microvascular thrombosis with microangiopathy and occlusion of capillaries. Thus, in severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients requiring oxygen therapy without initial macrovascular thrombotic event, a&#xD;
      HD-PA or a TA could be beneficial by limiting the extension of microvascular thrombosis and&#xD;
      the evolution of the lung and multi-organ microcirculatory dysfunction. In a large&#xD;
      observational cohort of 2,773 COVID-19 patients, a lower in-hospital mortality in ventilated&#xD;
      patients receiving TA as compared to those receiving PA (29.1% vs. 62.7%). Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      dual: i) first, that TA and HD-PA strategies mitigate microthrombosis and each limit the&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19, including respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction, with in&#xD;
      fine a decreased mortality and duration of disease, as compared to a low-dose PA; ii) second,&#xD;
      that TA outperforms HD-PA in this setting.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The research is a multicenter, parallel group, open-label, randomized controlled superiority trial, aiming at comparing three usual strategies of anticoagulation. The primary hierarchical criterion assessed at Day-28, includes all-cause mortality followed by the time to clinical improvement. The three strategies are LD-PA, HD-PA, and TA, with a 1:1:1 ratio</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Clinical improvement will be assessed through a seven-category ordinal scale derived from the WHO scale, using the following categories: 1. not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2. not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3. hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4. hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5. hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6. hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7. death. As all included patients will at least require oxygen supplementation, live discharge from hospital will represent a minimal 2-points decrease in the 7-points scale, thus a clinical improvement.</description>
