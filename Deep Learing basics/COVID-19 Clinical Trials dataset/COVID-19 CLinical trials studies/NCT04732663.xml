  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel corona virus emerged in 2019 causing Corona Virus Disease 2019 (covid-19). In one&#xD;
      year more than 80 000 000 cases worldwide were documented. Some patients experience symptoms,&#xD;
      specifically shortness of breath, long after the viral infection has passed. These patients&#xD;
      are colloquially known as &quot;Covid-19 Long-Haulers&quot; and it is currently unknown why symptoms&#xD;
      remain after infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shortness of breath and exercise intolerance may be caused by corona virus infection,&#xD;
      covid-19 therapy, and reduced physical activity. Exercise intolerance may be due to lung,&#xD;
      heart, blood vessel and muscle changes. During infection, the corona virus appears to cause&#xD;
      lung blood vessel and gas exchange surface damage. Early reports show heart dysfunction,&#xD;
      secondary to pulmonary blood vessel dysfunction or damage. Critically, no data is available&#xD;
      on lung blood vessel function or cardiac function during exercise. Moreover, no data are&#xD;
      available to link persistent symptoms to physiology parameters. To better understand symptom&#xD;
      persistence in Covid-19, the investigators aim to measure exercise tolerance and heart and&#xD;
      lung function in covid-19 survivors and compare them to covid-19 free controls.&#xD;

      Purpose and Justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In less than one year, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 80 000 000 people&#xD;
      worldwide. Infection causes Corona Virus Disease 2019 (covid-19) and in some cases severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome. Overall risk of mortality from covid-19 is low, however, risk&#xD;
      radically increases with age and cardiovascular comorbidity. The long-term consequences of&#xD;
      covid-19 are not known. Already a phenotype of survivors with prolonged symptom burden has&#xD;
      presented; this phenotype is characterized by persistent respiratory (cough, sputum, dyspnea,&#xD;
      wheeze) and musculoskeletal (pain, fatigue) symptoms. Preliminary data from clinical exercise&#xD;
      testing conducted at the UofA pulmonary function laboratory suggests covid-19 survivors with&#xD;
      prolonged symptoms have significantly reduced exercise tolerance and increased exertional&#xD;
      dyspnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired exercise tolerance measured as peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is the strongest&#xD;
      independent predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The investigators&#xD;
      preliminary data in seven persistently symptomatic covid-19 survivors (PS-CoV) 3-months post&#xD;
      molecular confirmation of infection shows a mean 30% impairment in VO2peak relative to age-,&#xD;
      sex- and body mass index matched controls. Several facets of covid-19, including treatment&#xD;
      and recovery, may contribute to the range and severity of debilitation and impairment in&#xD;
      VO2peak in PS-CoV. The purpose of this study is to investigate impairments in VO2peak, and&#xD;
      pulmonary, cardiac and peripheral factors contributing to impaired VO2peak, exercise&#xD;
      intolerance, and persistent dyspnea in PS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus gains cellular entry through binding angiotensin converting enzyme in the lungs,&#xD;
      making the lungs and pulmonary vasculature a logical starting point for investigation of&#xD;
      persistent symptomology. During active infection, pulmonary vascular dysfunction,&#xD;
      microthromboemboli, micro-angiopathy and pulmonary inflammation and/or fibrosis are reported.&#xD;
      Accompanying this is a reduction in diffusion capacity at rest, increased tortuosity of&#xD;
      pulmonary vasculature, and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. One mechanistic&#xD;
      explanation is that regions downstream of micro-thromboemboli become fibrotic secondary to&#xD;
      reduced blood flow resulting in reduced diffusion capacity. Physiological adaptation through&#xD;
      intussusceptive angiogenesis results in increased tortuosity of pulmonary vasculature, with a&#xD;
      secondary consequence of increased pulmonary vascular resistance. However, evidence of&#xD;
      isolated decreases in diffusion capacity in the absence of pulmonary fibrosis are at odds&#xD;
      with this theory. An alternative explanation is that pulmonary vascular dysfunction precedes&#xD;
      lesions viewed by computed tomography (CT) and changes in lung volumes. Regardless of&#xD;
      incipient damage, for ~1/3 of hospitalized covid-19 patients, the end result is pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis, impaired diffusion capacity (measured as the diffusion limitation of carbon&#xD;
      monoxide, DLCO), reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and proportionately reduced forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PS-CoV, lung impairment at 3-month follow-up is characterized by reduced resting DLCO, FVC&#xD;
      and FEV1, and incomplete normalization of pulmonary CT consolidation and opacities.13 The&#xD;
      investigators preliminary data in PS-CoV show increased respiratory rate and VE/VCO2&#xD;
      (indicative of increased deadspace or excessive ventilatory drive) at peak exercise-&#xD;
      characteristic of parenchymal or restrictive lung disease and consistent with pathology of&#xD;
      covid-19 including parenchymal cell death and pulmonary fibrosis. Despite these findings,&#xD;
      initial data suggest that PS-CoV patients' operating lung volumes during exercise and peak&#xD;
      breathing reserve are relatively preserved. Previous work in COPD has shown that an elevated&#xD;
      VE/VCO2 during exercise is explained by higher deadspace, and this increased VE/VCO2&#xD;
      contributes to increased dyspnea secondary to increased drive to breathe. The investigators&#xD;
      work in COPD has shown that the increase VE/VCO2 is due to hypoperfusion of the pulmonary&#xD;
      capillaries as demonstrated by a reduced DLCO and reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume&#xD;
      during exercise, and that when pulmonary perfusion is improved by using inspired NO, VE/VCO2&#xD;
      and dyspnea are decreased resulting in an increase in VO2peak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No data are currently available examining symptoms of dyspnea, pulmonary mechanics, VE/VCO2,&#xD;
      and impaired VO2peak in PS-CoV. Moreover, no data are available examining diffusion capacity&#xD;
      or pulmonary capillary blood volume responses during exercise, which may contribute to&#xD;
      increased VE/VCO2, pulmonary inefficiency, perceived dyspnea, and secondary cardiac&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac complications of covid-19 have been demonstrated and may contribute to impaired&#xD;
      VO2peak through a reduction in peak cardiac output (Qpeak). Limited data are available, but,&#xD;
      cardiac effects appear to be (mal)adaptation secondary to pulmonary vascular dysfunction,&#xD;
      angiopathy and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Importantly, pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction may impose a cardiac limitation to exercise in the absence of or preceding&#xD;
      structural cardiac changes as in early pulmonary hypertension (exercise induced pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension). Complications mimic those observed in pulmonary hypertension whereby the thin&#xD;
      walled right ventricle insidiously adapts to and eventually fails against chronically&#xD;
      increased pulmonary artery pressure. This includes right ventricular hypertrophy, dilation&#xD;
      and hypokinesis, and in failure, uncoupling of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion&#xD;
      (TAPSE) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). In a study of 100 consecutive covid-19&#xD;
      patients at rest, 39% of patients had right ventricular dilation and dysfunction and 16% of&#xD;
      patients had left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. No reports of cardiac function during&#xD;
      exercise or cardiac mechanics in response to stress are available following covid-19, and it&#xD;
      is unknown whether cardiac consequences of covid-19 limit VO2peak or contribute to symptom&#xD;
      persistence in PS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detrimental changes in body composition occur in hospitalized covid-19 patients. During&#xD;
      active infection, frailty (in part characterized by muscle loss) is associated with increased&#xD;
      covid-19 severity and mortality. Reduced lean tissue mass and increased adiposity,&#xD;
      particularly in the thigh, are reported following bedrest and are known to impair VO2peak.&#xD;
      Reductions in VO2peak are twofold: absolute VO2peak is reduced due to loss of muscle mass,&#xD;
      and relative VO2peak (ml/kg/min) is reduced due to a combination of reduced absolute VO2peak&#xD;
      and a decrease in the ratio of muscle mass to total body mass. Moreover, bedrest is&#xD;
      associated with reduced mitochondrial density and oxidative enzymatic activity. No data are&#xD;
      available linking increased adiposity, reduced thigh muscle, or impaired muscle quality to&#xD;
      VO2peak or symptom persistence in PS-CoV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators preliminary data indicate VO2peak is impaired in PS-CoV survivors. The&#xD;
      magnitude of VO2peak, pulmonary, cardiac and peripheral impairment is not known in PS-CoV or&#xD;
      symptom free covid-19 survivors. Through this proposed study, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      comprehensively test VO2peak impairment in PS-CoV survivors and link physiology to symptom&#xD;
      persistence in covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 objectives of this study: 1) to evaluate VO2peak in PS-CoV and recovered covid-19&#xD;
      survivors (no longer symptomatic) compared to covid-19 naïve controls matched for age, sex&#xD;
      and body mass index; 2) to evaluate DLCO and pulmonary capillary blood volume at rest and&#xD;
      during exercise in these three groups; and 3) evaluate cardiac structure and function at rest&#xD;
      and during exercise in the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. VO2peak will be impaired in PS-CoV relative to recovered (symptom free) covid-19&#xD;
           survivors and covid naïve controls, and that recovered covid-19 survivors will have&#xD;
           impaired VO2peak relative to covid naïve controls;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relative to covid-19 naïve controls, PS-CoV will have reduced rest and exercise&#xD;
           pulmonary capillary blood volume and diffusion capacity, which will be correlated with&#xD;
           exercise VE/VCO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PS-CoV will have reduced peak cardiac output, increased PASP, and uncoupling of&#xD;
           PASP:TAPSE.&#xD;
