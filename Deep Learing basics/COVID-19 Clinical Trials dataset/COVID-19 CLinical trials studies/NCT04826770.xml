      AICOVI (Adaptive Immune Response against Corona Virus Vaccination) is a prospective clinical&#xD;
      study aiming at elucidating the kinetics of vaccine-specific antibody production after&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination in health care workers at the Greifswald University hospital.&#xD;
      Participants regularly received two i.m. doses of BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®, BioNTech/Pfizer) with&#xD;
      a time distance of 21 days, or two i.m. doses of ChadOx1 nCov-19 (AZD 1222®, Oxford&#xD;
      University/Astra-Zeneca) with a time distance of 12 weeks. Within the study, volunteers&#xD;
      donate peripheral blood on each day of vaccination as well as 7 and 14 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination, and EDTA plasma and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are prepared and stored&#xD;
      at -20 °C. The vaccinees are also asked to complete a questionnaire (asking for previous&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, side effects of the vaccination, and atopies) on each day of blood&#xD;
      sampling.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Acute antibody production can be quantified using MENSA (medium enriched for newly synthesized antibodies), an approach that measures antibodies released from recently stimulated circulating antibody-secreting plasmablasts. For this purpose, PBMCs are collected from the subject's whole blood sample, washed to remove serum antibodies, and then cultured for 7 days. Antibodies released ex vivo from the antibody-secreting plasmablasts can now be detected in the culture supernatant. These newly synthesized antibodies are an excellent measure of the instantaneous antibody response.&#xD;
Sampling is conducted on the day of the 1st vaccination.</description>
