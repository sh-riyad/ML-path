  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the value-based effectiveness of the implementation of TMH Extended post&#xD;
      anaesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 pandemics by an institutional matched case-control&#xD;
      and quantitative survey study Two ordinary recovery beds were converted to an overnight&#xD;
      intensive recovery (&quot;Extended post-anesthetic care in PACU&quot;) within the operating theatre&#xD;
      complex of Tuen Mun Hospital during COVID-19 pandemics, in an attempt to free the ICU bed and&#xD;
      resources from postoperative patients. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      staff perceptions towards the abrupt implementation of TMH extended post-anesthetic care in&#xD;
      PACU by mobilization of the existing OT resources to cope with the COVID-19 emergency&#xD;
      situations. The value-based analysis would look into the implementation effectiveness in&#xD;
      twofold: 1) the clinical efficacy using a case-control audit on clinical outcomes and 2) the&#xD;
      staff acceptance by means of the staff attitudes survey. Hopefully, this would provide a&#xD;
      multi-perspective evaluation of the implementation strategies and aid planning of new&#xD;
      services in the future.&#xD;

      2 parts are included in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Matched Case-Control study, with the aim of analyzing the clinical efficacy of TMH&#xD;
      Extended post-anesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 in a value-based healthcare model. We&#xD;
      included all postoperative patients admitted in TMH Extended post-anesthetic care in PACU&#xD;
      during COVID epidemics, excluding patients awaiting ICU in the ordinary recovery room or&#xD;
      patients requiring level 3 intensive care on arrival in the recovery room. Three activation&#xD;
      periods of æ°´xtended post-anesthetic care in PACU service (10 Feb - 26 Apr 2020 / 27 Jul - 13&#xD;
      Sep 2020 / 14 Dec 2020 - 28 Feb 2021), and performed case matching with the postoperative&#xD;
      patient with similar clinical characteristics entering intensive care unit directly in recent&#xD;
      10 years, with each case matched with specifically 5 control. We evaluate the value-based&#xD;
      health care efficacy, including the amount of healthcare expenditure based on bed occupancy&#xD;
      and manpower, rate of elective discharge to intensive care unit from extended post-anesthetic&#xD;
      care in PACU, rate of unanticipated intensive care admission within 48hrs upon discharge to&#xD;
      the general ward, and length of hospital stay, and the total number of ICU bed spared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The staff attitude survey, with the aim to investigate the staff perception towards the&#xD;
      implementation of TMH extended post-anesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 pandemics based&#xD;
      on the Technology Acceptance Model in healthcare. We designed a questionnaire based on&#xD;
      Technology Acceptance Model, and distributed it to medical and nursing staff involved in&#xD;
      extended post anaesthetic care in PACU service, and evaluate the perceived usefulness,&#xD;
      perceived ease of use, social influence of subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control&#xD;
      of facilitating condition. A differential analysis would be conducted for the evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>From January 2020, during COVID-19 first pandemics in Hong Kong, a bundle of interim measures was implemented with the joint efforts of the Department of Anaesthesia and Operating Theatre Services (A&amp;OT) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and two ordinary recovery beds were converted into extended post anesthetic care in PACU (ExRR), based on the concept of overnight intensive recovery (OIR) to provide level 2 intensive care to patients undergoing major or ultra-major operations or having multiple comorbidities warranted intensive care in the immediately postoperative periods. This was conducted over 3 pandemic waves in Hong Kong.</description>

        o The operation periods of TMH Extended post anesthetic care in PACU during COVID-19 and&#xD;
        therefore the number of cases included in this study was largely bound by the&#xD;
        administrative decision of hospital management based on the ICU bed pressure during&#xD;
        COVID-19 situations. All patients being admitted to TMH Extended post anesthetic care in&#xD;
        PACU during the three periods of service activation amid COVID-19 pandemics, i.e. from 10&#xD;
        February 2020 to 26 April 2020, from 27 July 2020 to 13 September 2020, from 14 December&#xD;
        2020 to 28 February 2021 were included in this audit. To increase the statistical power&#xD;
        above 0.8, a control-to-case ratio of 5 will be adopted for case matching based on the&#xD;
        assumption of having the correlation coefficient greater than 0.2 or the prevalence of&#xD;
        exposure in the control group less than 0.15.&#xD;
