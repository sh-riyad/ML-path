      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be undergoing a 1-day screening to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. At day 1, patients who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner (participant and investigator) in a 1:1 ratio to ATR-002 (900mg day 1,&#xD;
      600mg days 2 - 6) or placebo (once daily)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Capable of giving signed informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Study participant must be at least 18 years of age at the time of signing the ICF&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Study participants with a laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
             presenting as moderate -to-severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization for COVID-19&#xD;
             (Clinical Severity Status [3] or [4]) and for medical reasons (see Section 8).&#xD;
             Patients presenting to the hospital without a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
             infection will be tested locally for SARS-CoV-2 during the screening period. For sites&#xD;
             in the EU: A CE certified SARS-CoV-2 PCR test kit is required to confirm infection.&#xD;
             For sites outside the EU: SARS-CoV-2 PCR test kits certified according to local&#xD;
             regulations are required to confirm infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Body weight at least 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18.0 kg/m2 and &lt; 40.0 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Male or female Contraceptive use by women and men should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical&#xD;
             studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. A female study participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Is a WOCBP and is using a contraceptive method that is highly effective, with a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt;1%, during the IMP period and for at least 4 weeks after the&#xD;
                  last dose of IMP. The investigator should evaluate the potential for&#xD;
                  contraceptive method failure (e.g., noncompliance, recently initiated) in&#xD;
                  relationship to the first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. A WOCBP must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours before the first&#xD;
             dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If a urine pregnancy test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous&#xD;
                  result), a serum pregnancy test is required locally. In such cases, the&#xD;
                  participant must not be randomized if the serum pregnancy result is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If a serum pregnancy test is required as per local regulations, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
                  test is required locally. In such cases, the participant must not be randomized&#xD;
                  if the serum pregnancy result is positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history,&#xD;
                  and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an&#xD;
                  early undetectable pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. A male study participant is eligible to participate if:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. He is azoospermic&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. The partner is not a WOCBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The partner is a WOCBP and is using a contraceptive method that is highly&#xD;
                  effective, with a failure rate of &lt;1%, during the IMP period and for at least 90&#xD;
                  days after the last dose of IMP. The investigator should evaluate the potential&#xD;
                  for contraceptive method failure (e.g., noncompliance, recently initiated) in&#xD;
                  relationship to the first dose of IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. He acknowledges that sperm donation is prohibited from the first dose of IMP&#xD;
                  until at least 90 days after the last dose of IMP.&#xD;
