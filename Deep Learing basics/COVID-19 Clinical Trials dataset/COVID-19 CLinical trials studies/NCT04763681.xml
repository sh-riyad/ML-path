  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will be a severe problem in Canada in the wake of&#xD;
      COVID-19, especially for Military Members, Veterans, First Responders, and Healthcare Workers&#xD;
      (MVFH). However, gold standard face-to-face PTSD treatments do not meet current MVFH needs,&#xD;
      which requires virtual interventions and minimal healthcare resources. Recognizing the need&#xD;
      for a virtual, low-resource PTSD intervention for MVFH with PTSD and their loved ones, the&#xD;
      investigators developed Couple HOPES (Helping Overcome PTSD and Enhance Satisfaction). Couple&#xD;
      HOPES is a secure, online self-help intervention for those with PTSD and their partners&#xD;
      (www.couplehopes.com). However, MVFH are now particularly likely to be exposed to traumas&#xD;
      related to COVID-19. It is essential to identify if Couple HOPES is safe and helpful for&#xD;
      couples involving MVFH with COVID-19-related PTSD specifically. This project will therefore&#xD;
      test the efficacy of Couple HOPES compared to a delayed waitlist control in 70 couples&#xD;
      wherein one member is a MVFH with COVID-19-related PTSD. The investigators will examine if&#xD;
      Couple HOPES is helpful in improving PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction for such&#xD;
      couples, and if it is more or less helpful to this end for these couples compared to those&#xD;
      with other forms of trauma exposure. 70 couples including a MVFH with COVID-19-related PTSD,&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive Couple HOPES or to a waitlist. PTSD symptoms and&#xD;
      relationship satisfaction will be measured ~weekly during the intervention and one month&#xD;
      after it. Related problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, healthcare use) will be measured&#xD;
      before, in the middle of, after, and one month after, the intervention.&#xD;
