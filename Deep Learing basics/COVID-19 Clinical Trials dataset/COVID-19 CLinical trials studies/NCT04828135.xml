  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to see a surge in an associated chronic&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary disease that will challenge health systems. Recovered patients are presenting&#xD;
      with persistent dyspnea at the Duke Pulmonary Post-COVID clinic. Evidence is now mounting&#xD;
      that recovered patients have significant residual pulmonary disease, while myocardial injury&#xD;
      has also been increasingly reported. To optimally care for these patients, Duke Pulmonary&#xD;
      study team must comprehensively assess and monitor the changes in cardiopulmonary function&#xD;
      and relate the changes to physiologic and quality of life outcomes. The study team will&#xD;
      deploy cutting-edge MRI to fully characterize cardiopulmonary function in enrolled 30&#xD;
      subjects (accrual 23 subjects) at time point 60-120 days post recovery and 6-9 months later.&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI will assess the myocardial status and right ventricular function, while&#xD;
      hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI will provide a 3D assessment of pulmonary ventilation, interstitial&#xD;
      barrier integrity, and pulmonary vascular hemodynamics. The overall objective outlined in&#xD;
      this study is to demonstrate the feasibility and value of comprehensive longitudinal imaging&#xD;
      characterization of cardiopulmonary structure and function in patients recovered from&#xD;
      Covid-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research builds on the established sensitivity of Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI to&#xD;
      obstructive and pulmonary vascular lung disease, features expected to represented in the&#xD;
      Covid-19 cohort. It further incorporates a new understanding of the possible role of&#xD;
      myocardial injury in these recovered patients by combining cutting-edge pulmonary and cardiac&#xD;
      MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the initial presentation of patients with moderate to severe symptoms of COVID19&#xD;
      infections is dominated by respiratory symptoms, 10% go on to develop persistent&#xD;
      post-infection symptoms which are thought to have an inflammatory etiology. Evidence suggests&#xD;
      that pathologic activation of the inflammasome persists beyond the acute initial presentation&#xD;
      that contributes to the persistent disabling symptoms characterized as &quot;long-haul COVID&quot;. For&#xD;
      this trial, subjects will be eligible for enrollment if subjects are outpatients with a&#xD;
      history of a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, and after 60 days or&#xD;
      longer. The study team will accrual 13 subjects who continue to have respiratory symptoms&#xD;
      (i.e., cough, shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion). An additional 10 subjects engaged in&#xD;
      competitive sports and diagnosed with COVID-19 will also be enrolled. These subjects can be&#xD;
      asymptomatic or mildly to moderately. Although rare, cardiac impairment has been documented&#xD;
      in &lt;2% of these individuals. The study team knowledge, XeMRI has not yet been studied in this&#xD;
      specific patient subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing data highlight significant racial and ethnic disparities with historically&#xD;
      underserved minority populations (i.e., Black, LatinX) suffering disproportionately higher&#xD;
      infection rates and more severe illness compared to Whites. This is reflected by the&#xD;
      population enrolled in the study team RedCAP database and biorepository. As such 30% of&#xD;
      subjects enrolled will be required to be from underserved communities.&#xD;
