      This study is aiming to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic stress on pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes including the sex ratio at birth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by a&#xD;
           single-strand, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus, severe acute respiratory&#xD;
           syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus (Masters, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sex ratio (ratio of boys to girls) at birth (SRB) is about 1.01-1.05 in most&#xD;
           populations (Abdoli, 2020). Various influencing factors affect the SRB, including&#xD;
           maternal stress, endocrine disruption, maternal inflammatory responses and maternal&#xD;
           nutrition (Lipner et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These stressful life events consequently influence on maternal immunological and&#xD;
           endocrine conditions, and the male fetuses are more vulnerable to be affected by these&#xD;
           conditions. It is of interest that male fetus is biologically weaker and more&#xD;
           susceptible to prenatal events and diseases than female fetuses. Hence, premature death&#xD;
           is higher in boys than girls (Ahrenfeldt et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recent pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been known to have&#xD;
           various impacts on pregnant women (Rasmussen et al., 2020). Placentas of infected&#xD;
           mothers show inflammatory, vascular and thrombotic changes (Prochaska et al., 2020).&#xD;
           Among the neonates, children and adults (Bjelosevic et al., 2017), higher morbidity and&#xD;
           mortality of males than females were reported. It is observed that the incidence of&#xD;
           stillbirth was significantly increased during the pandemic period than during the pre&#xD;
           pandemic period in London, UK (Khalilet al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The start of appearance of Covid 19 cases in Egypt was in March 2020, with subsequent&#xD;
           increase in cases with its peak in May, June and July 2020, with lockdown and social and&#xD;
           financial affection with great stress on families&#xD;

        c. Sample Size Calculation: As our study is a descriptive study aiming to explore the&#xD;
        changes in sex ratios and other pregnancy outcomes in different months of the two years&#xD;
        before and after COVID-19 pandemic. We will include all eligible records during those years&#xD;
        (total coverage sample). Expected number per year according to previous records is 7000&#xD;
        cases&#xD;
