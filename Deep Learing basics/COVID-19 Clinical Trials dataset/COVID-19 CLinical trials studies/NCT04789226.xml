      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new communicable disease caused by the new strains&#xD;
      of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 . The first outbreak reported&#xD;
      was in December2019, in Wuhan, China, as pneumonia of unknown etiology linked to a seafood&#xD;
      market exposure COVID-19 affects different people in different ways. Most infected people&#xD;
      will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evolution of the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) and its expeditious dissemination&#xD;
      have led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare it a pandemic on 11 March 2020 . As&#xD;
      of 16 May 2020, there have been 4,425,485 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 302,059 related deaths&#xD;
      worldwide and Egypt has been among the most affected countries in the Eastern Mediterranean&#xD;
      region with 11,228 confirmed cases and 592 deaths .&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, many countries, including Egypt, have set a state of lockdown to hinder the&#xD;
      spread of infection among people resulting in a global atmosphere of depression and anxiety&#xD;
      associated with social isolation, fears of getting infected, breaks in the supply chains,&#xD;
      financial distress, disrupted travel plans, and future uncertainty . Several epidemiological&#xD;
      studies from China detected a high prevalence of psychological disturbances among the public&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a large online survey of 56,679 individuals from&#xD;
      34 provinces in China reported numerous psychological conditions during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic: depression (27.9%), anxiety (31.6%), stress (24.4%), and insomnia (29.2%) . Also, a&#xD;
      study conducted on 4872 Chinese people from 31 provinces showed a high prevalence of&#xD;
      depression (48.3%) and anxiety (22.6%) related to the COVID-19 pandemic . A similar study&#xD;
      revealed depression (20.1%), anxiety (35.1%), and poor sleeping (18.2%) among 7236 Chinese&#xD;
      people . Another study conducted on 7143 college students in China detected anxiety among 25%&#xD;
      of them .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In low- and middle-income countries, such as Egypt, where infection control precautions,&#xD;
      surveillance programs, laboratory capacity, and public health resources are limited , the&#xD;
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging and, as a result, the psychological impacts&#xD;
      of the pandemic on the public can be even worse. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate&#xD;
      several forms of psychological disturbances .&#xD;
