  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a general anaesthetic, patients cannot breathe on their own and have to be&#xD;
      artificially ventilated. This is achieved by connecting the patient's windpipe (trachea) to a&#xD;
      ventilator via the use of a plastic tube called an endotracheal tube (ETT). To place this ETT&#xD;
      into the patient's trachea, an instrument called a laryngoscope is used to lift the tongue&#xD;
      and view the entrance to the trachea. This process is called laryngoscopy. The act of placing&#xD;
      this ETT into the trachea is called intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In anticipation of this procedure, the airway is assessed by the anaesthetist before the&#xD;
      patient is put to sleep. This airway examination helps predict if the patient's airway will&#xD;
      prove to be difficult to intubate. This assessment is usually carried out face to face with&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we have been trying to minimise patient footfall&#xD;
      performing anaesthetic assessments before surgery through a video platform. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to compare these video airway evaluations to assessments carried out face to&#xD;
      face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate that the virtual airway assessments will be similar if not the same as the&#xD;
      in-person airway assessments.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational study. We are comparing the agreement between a virtual&#xD;
      video airway evaluation and an inpatient person-to-doctor airway assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be referred for virtual preoperative assessment clinic by the gynaecology&#xD;
      outpatient department based on inclusion criteria and a patient information leaflet and&#xD;
      consent form is supplied at this time. During the virtual assessment consent is taken,&#xD;
      followed by a standard history and airway examination. The airway assessment will be&#xD;
      performed by an investigator of &gt;5 years anaesthetic experience and will have to undergo a&#xD;
      standardised airway assessment training. This airway evaluation is also documented separate&#xD;
      to the remainder of the history, sealed in an envelope and labelled a designated number. On&#xD;
      the date of surgery, the patient is assessed again by an investigator in the ward/theatre&#xD;
      prior to surgery. This airway examination is documented on the standard anaesthetic record&#xD;
      sheet as well as on a separate in-person evaluation form. This airway assessment form is then&#xD;
      sealed in an envelope and labelled the same designated number as the virtual assessment. The&#xD;
      evaluations will be entered into a database and analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the evaluation is found to show predictors of a difficult airway in the virtual clinic,&#xD;
      the patient is scheduled for an in-person outpatient appointment. The airway is then assessed&#xD;
      by an investigator in-person at the clinic. The airway is then assessed by an anaesthetic&#xD;
      consultant and documented on the anaesthetic record sheet. Investigators will have no further&#xD;
      involvement in the clinical management of the patient.&#xD;
