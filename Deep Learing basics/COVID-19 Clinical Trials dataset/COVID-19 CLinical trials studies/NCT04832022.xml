  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, studies on SARS-CoV2and vaccines have been mostly from the general population not&#xD;
      exposed to immunosuppressants. The efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines need to be&#xD;
      evaluated in these populations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Longitudinal, comparative, controlled, observational multicenter study based on a cohort of&#xD;
      1500 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients with CIRs from the COVID-RIC1 cohort: 750 accepting&#xD;
      vaccination and 750 refusing vaccination matched on age (+/-10 years), gender, rheumatism and&#xD;
      recruiting center. Schedule: 4 visits over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational routine care study was initiated in 15 French hospitals to assess the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in France in a population with CIRs. The project plans to screen&#xD;
      5000 CIRs patients. The COVID-RIC3 study will thus be proposed to these pre-screened subjects&#xD;
      according to their agreement or refusal to be vaccinated against COVID-19 based on a question&#xD;
      asked at the time of their inclusion in COVID-RIC1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of the SARS-CoV2 vaccines as well as the vaccine-induced humoral&#xD;
      immune responses and their maintenance over time in immunosuppressed patients with CIRs are&#xD;
      essential to guide vaccine recommendations in these specific immunocompromised populations in&#xD;
      terms of &quot;boost&quot; or booster.&#xD;
