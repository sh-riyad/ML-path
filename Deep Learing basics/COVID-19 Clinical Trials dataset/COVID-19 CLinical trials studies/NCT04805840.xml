  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess how an at-home COVID-19 frequent testing regimen using the CoV-SCAN&#xD;
      test kit and a paired phone application to help interpret the test result compares to&#xD;
      once-a-week or three-times-a-week polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (molecular) testing to&#xD;
      identify a SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees and cast members at Media and Entertainment Company and its affiliates will be&#xD;
      recruited to test whether frequent use of CoV-SCAN will perform as well or better than weekly&#xD;
      molecular testing and at least as well as three-times-a-week molecular testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antigen tests are simple to perform, have a rapid turn-around time of 15-30 minutes, and a&#xD;
      lower cost than molecular tests. Because antigen tests do not incorporate an amplification&#xD;
      step, they are intrinsically less sensitive than PCR molecular tests. Nevertheless, several&#xD;
      investigators have examined the feasibility of screening populations of individuals in a low&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence situation, such as the workplace or schools, with rapid&#xD;
      antigen tests in place of the molecular tests. Using viral kinetics, knowledge of what level&#xD;
      of viral load is required for transmission of culture-competent virus, test sensitivity and&#xD;
      modeling, they have come to the conclusion that more frequent testing with a test with lower&#xD;
      sensitivity that has a quick turn-around time is better than a test with high sensitivity&#xD;
      with a longer turn-around time. Therefore, the goal of this study is to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that frequent testing with a relatively sensitive lateral flow antigen test performed at home&#xD;
      using self-collected anterior nasal swabs will be superior to once a week or less PCR testing&#xD;
      and non-inferior to three times a week PCR testing in an employment screening setting with a&#xD;
      relatively low incidence of new SARS-CoV-2 infections. This study aims to assess how an&#xD;
      at-home COVID-19 frequent testing regimen using a Rapid Antigen Screening Test (RAST) and a&#xD;
      phone application to help interpret the test result compares to once-a-week or&#xD;
      three-times-a-week PCR (molecular) testing to identify a SARS-CoV-2 infection. We expect to&#xD;
      recruit up to 4,400 employees and cast members of Media and Entertainment Company and its&#xD;
      affiliates to test whether frequent use of the RAST will perform as well or better than&#xD;
      weekly molecular testing and at least as well as three-times-a-week molecular testing.&#xD;
      Recruitment and the study will continue until at least 31 or at most 148 true positive&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 molecular results are reached.&#xD;
