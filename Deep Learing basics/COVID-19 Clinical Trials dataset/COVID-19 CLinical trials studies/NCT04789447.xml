      This study aims to Turkey in two Step 3 hospitals in the Covidien-19 clinical patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with the diagnosis, laboratory and radiological characteristics, comorbidities,&#xD;
      treatment received, hospitalization time, to examine the invasive mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      needs and mortality rates, only with CT findings, only rrt- To determine whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in prognosis between cases with PCR positivity and both of them are positive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the SARS-CoV-2 virus was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it spread&#xD;
      rapidly all over the world, and the World Health Organization declared &quot;International Public&#xD;
      Health Emergency&quot; in January 2020. The first Covid-19 case in our country was seen on March&#xD;
      11, 2020, and then spread rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is a member of the coronavirus&#xD;
      family, has similar genetic and clinical characteristics to the SARS-CoV virus, which caused&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory tract infection in 2003 and caused epidemics. Covid-19 patients also&#xD;
      have clinical diversity in terms of laboratory and computed tomography (CT) findings. . In a&#xD;
      study conducted, &quot;real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction&quot; (rRT-PCR)&#xD;
      positivity was found to be 83.3% and CT positivity was 97.2% . It is not known whether there&#xD;
      is a difference in prognosis in patients with only CT findings, only rRT-PCR positivity, and&#xD;
      both positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study, two tertier hospital in Turkey, laboratory and radiological&#xD;
      characteristics, comorbidities, treatment received, hospitalization time, to examine the&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation needs and mortality rates, only with CT findings, only with&#xD;
      positive RRT-PCR and to determine whether there is a difference between cases where both are&#xD;
      positive.&#xD;
