  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The coronavirus pandemic has had demonstrable impact upon healthcare workers. For healthcare&#xD;
      workers this has meant disruption to vital access to peer support networks. In May 2020 the&#xD;
      United Nations (UN) published a policy brief highlighting the importance of supporting mental&#xD;
      health and wellbeing for communities affected by coronavirus. There is a need to find&#xD;
      innovative solutions to facilitate support in the post-COVID-19 era and some innovations are&#xD;
      emerging to fill this void but an evidence, long-term, sustainable, solution is yet to be&#xD;
      proposed. In response, a digital app has been co-developed by UK researchers and healthcare&#xD;
      staff with the intent to facilitate a virtual peer support mechanism for National Health&#xD;
      Service (NHS) staff.&#xD;

      Rationale: The coronavirus pandemic has had demonstrable impact upon healthcare workers. For&#xD;
      healthcare workers this has meant disruption to vital access to peer support networks. In May&#xD;
      2020 the United Nations (UN) published a policy brief highlighting the importance of&#xD;
      supporting mental health and wellbeing for communities affected by coronavirus. There is a&#xD;
      need to find innovative solutions to facilitate support in the post-COVID-19 era and some&#xD;
      innovations are emerging to fill this void but an evidence, long-term, sustainable, solution&#xD;
      is yet to be proposed. In response, a digital app has been co-developed by UK researchers and&#xD;
      healthcare staff with the intent to facilitate a virtual peer support mechanism for National&#xD;
      Health Service (NHS) staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The main aim of this research is to determine the acceptability and efficacy of the&#xD;
      newly developed I-care app to facilitate peer-support for NHS staff wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A mixed methods study with concurrent process evaluation will be conducted to&#xD;
      explore the acceptability and efficacy of an app-based peer support platform for use by&#xD;
      anyone working within Solent NHS Trust with access to an android mobile phone device. Data&#xD;
      will be generated from quantitative app usage, binary survey responses, and qualitative&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Populations: All staff within Solent NHS Trust with an android mobile phone will be&#xD;
      considered eligible to use the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Data will be collected at one, three, six, and 12-months post app launch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes: As the innovation developed has spanned biomedical, behavioural and&#xD;
      computing science a range of exploratory methods are proposed to establish the reach and&#xD;
      uptake of the innovation, early indication of a potential causal model explaining how the&#xD;
      innovation could lead to benefit, identification of key components of the innovation as&#xD;
      identified by end users, and estimation of overall acceptability and efficacy.&#xD;
