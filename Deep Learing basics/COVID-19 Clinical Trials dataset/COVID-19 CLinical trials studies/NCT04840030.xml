  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The GOIZ ZAINDU Gipuzkoa - GO - ON Study is an intervention trial to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      dementia prevention strategies in cognitively frail people. It is a large-scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in over 1000 older adults between 60 and 85 years old with increased CAIDE&#xD;
      risk score (≥6), non-demented but with low performance in at least one of three brief&#xD;
      cognitive tests. Participants will be randomized to receive standard health advice&#xD;
      (SHA-control) or a multidomain intervention (MM-Int) consisting of 1) Risk factor control&#xD;
      (vascular factors, polypharmacy); 2) Cognitive training, 3) Physical activity, 4) Dietary&#xD;
      changing program, and 5) emotional counseling and social engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to demonstrate a 20% reduction in the proportion of subjects who decline&#xD;
      in their NTB performance (z score) after 24 months in the intervention group compared to the&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include: 1) Analyze cost-effectiveness; 2) Show a beneficial effect of the&#xD;
      intervention on functional abilities, quality of life, and depressive and anxiety symptoms;&#xD;
      3) Investigate the impact of a lifestyle intervention on aging. In this sense, biological&#xD;
      samples and neuroimaging studies will be collected to allow exploratory investigations on&#xD;
      aging mechanisms, amyloid imbalance, tau pathology, epigenetics, neuroinflammation, vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction, lipid dysregulation, white matter disintegration, cognitive and brain reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is participant-centered, empowering citizens since the recruitment process to&#xD;
      gain access to knowledge about their dementia risk status via web or by phone and then decide&#xD;
      to participate. Intervention activities have also taken into account participants'&#xD;
      perspective with the design of easy-to-use and appealing activities (e.g., using a&#xD;
      self-administered at-home physical activity program such as VIVIFRAIL© and EXERCITA©&#xD;
      cognitive training materials that have been developed, taking into account the Basque Country&#xD;
      population's cultural, linguistic and educational particularities; and diet and nutritional&#xD;
      workshops with famous chefs to learn innovative and attractive healthy recipes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GO-ON trial may shed light on the tools that people need to fulfill the expectation of an&#xD;
      active, healthy dementia-free aging. These include digital tools that in the COVID19 pandemic&#xD;
      have shown to be effective in removing distance barriers. GO-ON uses them to give support and&#xD;
      expand the possibilities to clinical assessment settings and intervention delivery. The&#xD;
      digital part of the intervention may expand preventive actions to small rural areas,&#xD;
      including digital socialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GO-ON Study, which starts in summer 2021, is the first large-scale lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      trial in Southern Europe that takes part in the WORLDWIDE FINGERs network and will help&#xD;
      answer whether the FINGER results can be replicated. The intervention design has been made on&#xD;
      the basis that if proven to be efficacious, it may be easily applied at a Public System-level&#xD;
      to guarantee a rapid and easy translation of research results to Primary Care settings and&#xD;
      people homes.&#xD;

    <measure>Global Cognitive performance</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive performance will be assessed with the Neuropsychological Test Battery modified (NTBm) (Harrison J. et aet al.ch Neurol 2007).&#xD;
The NTBm consists of 9 validated components:NTBm Cognitive global, executive function, memory, processing speed scores will be obtained. Composite cognitive z-scores based on the results from all single tests will be calculated. Single z-scores will be calculated using baseline mean and standard deviations of the study sample and, for each composite score, single z-scores will be averaged. Higher scores suggest better performance.</description>

    <measure>Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention program the Incremental Cost-Utility Ratio (ICUR) between muntidomain intervention group and regular health advice group.&#xD;
The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) will be estimated by dividing incremental cost (Ca-Cb) by incremental utility (Ua-Ub). The time horizon was the patient's lifetime. A 3% discount rate will be applied to costs and effectiveness. Since the main economic impact of dementia is related to the care required as patients become dependent, a societal perspective will be used.</description>

    <measure>Amsterdam questionnaire for Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (A-IADL-Q)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Amsterdam IADL Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) is an adaptive and computerized questionnaire designed to assess impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in (early) dementia. The questionnaire is completed by a caregiver, such as a relative or friend. (Sikkes SA et al. 2012).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in perceived Quality of life - EQ-D-5L scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L (Herdman M. et al. 2011) essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'.</description>

    <measure>Depressive and anxiety sympthoms. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>HADS was originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983) and is commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a person is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen-item scale that generates: Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.</description>
