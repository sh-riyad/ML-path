      The investigators' aim is to conduct a study looking into safety and feasibility study of&#xD;
      Covid patients participating in a self-guided exercises program while admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital. The investigators will test 2 forms of exercise instruction, one using an exercise&#xD;
      phone-based application, and the other a printed exercise manual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality throughout the&#xD;
      world. As of March 16, 2021 there were over 119 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2.6&#xD;
      million deaths globally. The majority of COVID-19 cases are mild to moderate, resulting in&#xD;
      symptom resolution within 6 weeks of symptom onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following moderate to severe COVID-19 infections, functional impairments are likely to be&#xD;
      dominated by peripheral muscle dysfunction (due to deconditioning and decreased lean body&#xD;
      mass, ICU neuropathy, fatigue and the effects of hypoxemia), respiratory muscle dysfunction&#xD;
      (dysfunctional breathing pattern, DBP, and exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction), cardiac&#xD;
      impairment and deconditioning, and psychosocial factors (anxiety, depression, guilt, sleep&#xD;
      disturbance and dependency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exercise has proven to be an effective therapy for most chronic diseases and&#xD;
      microbial infections with preventive or therapeutic benefits involving the primary&#xD;
      immunological mediators and/or anti-inflammatory properties. Another mechanism is that it can&#xD;
      counteract the effect of prolonged bedrest by preventing the decline in muscle strength,&#xD;
      muscle mass loss , reduce exaggerated cardiac response to exercise, reduce thromboembolism,&#xD;
      and improve lung function. Prior research in COPD patients have shown that early pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation showed reductions in mortality, length of stay and readmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some concern among physicians about allowing patients with COVID-19 to&#xD;
      exercise. This is also of concern to all practitioners of Rehabilitation Medicine and the&#xD;
      investigators seek to understand the risks better. This research group is currently&#xD;
      concluding another retrospective study of 988 COVID-19 patients that suggest that not only is&#xD;
      exercise safe, but increasing the number of exercise interventions improves the functional&#xD;
      status of the patients and may reduce mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the next step, the investigators propose a 12-month, single blind feasibility study to&#xD;
      determine if adding a self-guided exercise to a patient population already receiving two&#xD;
      30-minutes/week therapy can improve the patient's overall functional and cognitive outcomes.&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital with mild to&#xD;
      moderate disease can safely perform these exercises and improve their physical and cognitive&#xD;
      functioning. The objective in performing this study is to examine feasibility as well as&#xD;
      obtain preliminary data to design future RCT studies in this or other similar diseases. The&#xD;
      self-guided exercise program was developed by the Department of Rehabilitation at Montefiore&#xD;
      during the initial COVID-19 surge. The manual has been published in the Journal for the&#xD;
      International Society of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine and has been distributed&#xD;
      through many medical society websites. COVID-19 patients admitted to the Montefiore Hospital&#xD;
      have been receiving the exercise manual upon discharge for the past 9 months. The exercises&#xD;
      in the program are divided into 3 levels. The initial level focuses on prevention of lung&#xD;
      complication associated with COVID-19, and prevention of contracture in the large joints&#xD;
      associated with bedrest. The next level focuses on improving sitting tolerance, strengthening&#xD;
      limb and accessory muscles of breathing. The final level works on standing balance, large&#xD;
      muscle strengthening, and building cardiopulmonary endurance The investigators will test 2&#xD;
      modes of delivery, one using the printed exercise manual and the other using Pt PAL, a mobile&#xD;
      health technology application. Pt PAL can facilitate communication between the care team and&#xD;
      patients, and allows the team to send from their web-portal, exercise routines, surveys and&#xD;
      educational material to the patient's mobile device. The Pt PAL app then captures the patient&#xD;
      activity adherence, and reports those results back to the team including a graphical summary&#xD;
      about patients' condition and activity. The investigators have successfully applied Pt PAL&#xD;
      exercise program to other patient populations (e.g., heart failure patients) in Montefiore&#xD;
      Medical Center, and the app has received regulatory approval at Montefiore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team composed of Rehabilitation Medicine physician, Internal Medicine&#xD;
      specialist, rehabilitation therapists, nursing, medical students and research staff are very&#xD;
      well positioned to carry out a study of this nature effectively and safely to its conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the changes in the following measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)12 which was developed to examine basic&#xD;
           mobility and daily activity functional activities important to adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. St George's Respiratory function questionnaire to assess pulmonary function. It is&#xD;
           scored for symptoms, physical activity, and impact domains&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB ) is a series of physical performance tests&#xD;
           used in older persons to assess lower extremity function, balance and mobility and is&#xD;
           predictive of a broad range of adverse outcomes, including mortality, incident&#xD;
           disability, falls, hospitalization and healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The Picture Memory Impairment Screen is a brief, 4-item free and cued recall test of&#xD;
           memory that uses pictures to overcome many of the educational, cultural, and logistical&#xD;
           barriers to cognitive screening in clinical settings and is nondiscriminatory with&#xD;
           regard to culture and literacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Paper Match Stimuli, a rapid paper test that can be administered under 3 minutes&#xD;
           correlate predominantly with brain regions mediating information processing speed (i.e.,&#xD;
           basal ganglia) and executive functions (i.e., dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal&#xD;
           cortex&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report rating inventory that&#xD;
           measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression, which can help identify&#xD;
           patients whose motivation for exercise may be impacted by depression&#xD;
