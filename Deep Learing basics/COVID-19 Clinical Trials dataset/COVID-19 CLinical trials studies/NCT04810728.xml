  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was an experimental, randomized clinical trial, with a parallel design, with aims&#xD;
      were seeing the effectiveness of extracted Psidii guava on white blood cells (WBCs) count,&#xD;
      neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), high sensitive C&#xD;
      reactive protein (hs-CRP), proportion and duration COVID-19 seroconversion subjects compared&#xD;
      to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the herbs standardized that was commonly used in Indonesia is extracted Psidii guava,&#xD;
      which is known as a guava leaf extract. Extract Psidii guava contains chemical substances&#xD;
      saponins, oleanolic acid, xylopyranoside, flavonoids, quercetin, arabinopyranoside, and&#xD;
      Guaijavarin. The Previous study on Psidii guava stated that guava leaves contain lots of&#xD;
      flavonoids, especially quercetin. An in vitro study of dengue virus type 2 found that&#xD;
      quercetin significantly inhibited the activity of the DEN-2 virus, while other flavonoids&#xD;
      looked weaker. On the other hand, in an in vitro test of glycosylated flavonoids from Psidium&#xD;
      Geunesse, which is a guava leaf from Brazil, received the use of flavonoids in Psidium&#xD;
      Geunesse to inhibit HIV-1 virus activity with a 50% inhibition concentration of about 8.5 μg&#xD;
      / ml compared to single active substances. Quercetin with a 50% inhibitory concentration of&#xD;
      about 53μg / ml. These flavonoids also inhibited the enzyme reverse transcriptase&#xD;
      HIV-1(RT)with an inhibition concentration of 7.2 μM compared to quercetin 0.6 μM single.&#xD;
      Another study found that quercetin in Psidii guava inhibits RNA polymerase, which is&#xD;
      important in dengue virus replication. In addition, quercetin can inhibit protease enzyme,&#xD;
      helicase domain, and viral ATPase enzyme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an antiviral effect based on limited in vitro studies but with quite a lot of&#xD;
      literature studies, and considering that there are no effective antiviral drugs against&#xD;
      COVID-19, especially mild and moderate cases, also considering the length of healing time for&#xD;
      patients COVID-19 with the risk of isolation. For a long time with various consequences,&#xD;
      researchers tried to examine the effectiveness of extract Psidii guava inpatients COVID-19 at&#xD;
      the quarantine location of the West Sumatra Provincial Government. Extract Psidii guava is&#xD;
      hypothesized to improve WBCs, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, NLR, hs-CRP level, to&#xD;
      increase proportion and shorten the duration of COVID-19 seroconversion in mild and&#xD;
      symptomless cases.&#xD;

      There will be 2 groups of treatment; each group will consist of 45 subjects with the&#xD;
      treatment regimens maximal for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment I: 2 capsules of Extract Psidii guava, three times daily. Treatment II:&#xD;
      standard therapy for Covid-19 patient (vitamin C, Zink, medication for clinical symptoms such&#xD;
      as antipyretic agent, decongestant, and mucolytic).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive study medication (Treatment 1 or&#xD;
      Treatment 2) for 7 days, if the result swab after treatment still positive, patients will be&#xD;
      given extract Psidii guava capsule with the same dose till maximal 4 weeks. Treatment Group 1&#xD;
      will receive 2 capsules of Extract Psidii guava, three times daily. While Treatment Group 2&#xD;
      will receive the standard therapy for Covid-19 patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for treatment efficacy at baseline 7 days after treatment and 28&#xD;
      days (4 weeks) treatment. The demographic profile, such as age and sex, will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline. White blood cells count, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, NLR, hs-CRP level at&#xD;
      baseline and 7 days after treatment, while proportion and duration COVID-19 seroconversion&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
