  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in several challenges in service delivery for the eating&#xD;
      disorders program at McMaster Children's Hospital. Long waiting lists prior to the pandemic&#xD;
      (6-9 month wait time) have been made worse by an interruption in service during the initial&#xD;
      stages of the pandemic. New routine assessments were placed on hold for many months, while&#xD;
      only the most urgently ill children were seen. This, in combination with a dramatic increase&#xD;
      in new referrals has resulted in a long waitlist. Now families are waiting 12-18 months for&#xD;
      service. The resulting waitlist is now unmanageable and unsafe. Investigators wish to study&#xD;
      the implementation of a waitlist intervention which will educate parents on how to start to&#xD;
      renourish their children and interrupt eating disordered behaviors. The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of a series of educational videos and a book on how to help their children. It is&#xD;
      hoped that this intervention can lessen the need for hospitalization and can change the&#xD;
      trajectory of symptoms while waiting for service. A clinical care pathway will also be&#xD;
      developed to ensure those waiting receive the most appropriate treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators would like to study the implementation of an adapted FBT model in which there&#xD;
      is no therapist involvement and the intervention is delivered to families on the waitlist of&#xD;
      Eating Disorder program at McMaster Children's Hospital. The intervention would involve a&#xD;
      series of prerecorded videos and reading material. This, in combination with the development&#xD;
      of a clinical care pathway, would help to manage the extraordinary volumes of referrals&#xD;
      recently been received. The need to social distance brought on by the pandemic presents the&#xD;
      opportunity to consider the value of this waitlist intervention as a structured program for&#xD;
      parents who have a child waiting for service. A model such as this could dramatically improve&#xD;
      parental abilities to begin to re-feed their children, thereby reducing acuity and time spent&#xD;
      in treatment. Similarly, some parents on the waitlist may decide that the proposed treatment&#xD;
      model is not suitable after they have received the proposed waitlist intervention, and may&#xD;
      wish to seek treatment elsewhere. Alternatively, parents may be able to shift the pattern of&#xD;
      weight loss and/or binge purge behavior in children so that the severity of illness is&#xD;
      decreased by the time of assessment. If successful, this intervention and clinical care&#xD;
      pathway for waitlisted patients and their families could be disseminated to other tertiary&#xD;
      care centers, thereby reducing mounting pressures on these centers.&#xD;
