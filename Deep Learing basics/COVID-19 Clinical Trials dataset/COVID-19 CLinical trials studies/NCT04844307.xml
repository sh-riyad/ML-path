  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of twice-a-day 15-minute sessions of&#xD;
      inpatient physical therapy (PT) to the standard daily 30 minute sessions. The patient&#xD;
      outcomes that will be evaluated will be length of stay, change in functional status, and&#xD;
      disposition (home/acute rehab vs. subacute/LTAC/death) in patients admitted with COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The 2019 pandemic struck New York City hospitals early and aggressively. In rehabilitating&#xD;
      inpatients during the early part of the pandemic, we learned that many of them were too&#xD;
      affected by the COVID-19 illness to be able to tolerate the typical 30-minute daily session&#xD;
      of physical therapy. At that time, the physical therapy (PT) staff often accommodated&#xD;
      patients by dividing the typical 30 minute daily session into two 15 minute sessions in an&#xD;
      effort to increase patient tolerance and participation. However, it was discovered at that&#xD;
      time that literature was scarce on whether these divided PT sessions were equal or superior&#xD;
      to the typical sessions. Nor was there any substantial literature on whether shorter duration&#xD;
      higher frequency sessions were better tolerated by the inpatient. The purpose of this&#xD;
      prospective randomized non-blinded controlled study is to compare outcomes of COVID&#xD;
      inpatients receiving one 30 minute daily session of PT to patients receiving two 15 minute&#xD;
      daily sessions of PT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to obtain high quality data on level of mobility during hospitalization, two&#xD;
      separate scoring systems will be used: The AMPAC and JH-HLM scores. These two scoring systems&#xD;
      have been selected for their wide acceptance in both the physiatry and physical therapy&#xD;
      communities, and due to having confirmed inter-rater reliability and validity. These scores&#xD;
      will be calculated by the physical therapist on initial evaluation, and then again on every&#xD;
      session up until discharge. The physical therapy team at this community hospital have already&#xD;
      received extensive education on the utilization of both of these scoring tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is to determine whether shorter duration (15 minute) higher&#xD;
      frequency sessions (2x a day) are better tolerated than the standard 30-minute session. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that shorter duration higher frequency sessions are superior to standard&#xD;
      inpatient PT sessions in terms of patient tolerance and change in mobility scores from&#xD;
      admission to discharge. Supporting evidence is based on previous observation and from a&#xD;
      recent survey given to 19 physical therapists actively working with COVID-19 inpatients at&#xD;
      White plains Hospital: Healthier patients have a higher tolerance of the 30 minute sessions,&#xD;
      and sicker patients have a poor tolerance of the 30 minute sessions.&#xD;
