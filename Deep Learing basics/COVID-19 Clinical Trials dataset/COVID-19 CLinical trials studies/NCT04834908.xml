  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective, Randomized, Multi-center, Open label, Phase 1/2 study to Evaluate the&#xD;
      Safety and Efficacy of Equine COVID-19 Antiserum [F(ab')2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      BSV has developed Equine COVID-19 antiserum from horse serum for the use in COVID-19&#xD;
      infection. The indication proposed is to provide passive immunization to the COVID-19&#xD;
      infected patient thereby reducing the viral load and prevention of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical phase 1 and phase 2 studies have been planned to be conducted. The phase 1 study&#xD;
      will be conducted on two dosages to find the safety and tolerability in patients. Based on&#xD;
      the results of phase 1 study the phase 2 shall be initiated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Clinical phase 1 and phase 2 studies have been planned to be conducted. The phase 1 study will be conducted on two dosages to find the safety and tolerability in patients. Each patient will receive either of the dose BSVEQAb - 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg body weight and all will receive standard of care&#xD;
Based on the results of phase 1 study the phase 2 shall be initiated. In phase 2 study one group will receive the tolerable dose of BSVEQAb selected along with standard of care. The second group will receive only standard of care.</intervention_model_description>
