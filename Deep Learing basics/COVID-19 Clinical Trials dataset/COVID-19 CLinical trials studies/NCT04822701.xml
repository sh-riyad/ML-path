  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with mild to moderate symptoms of COVID-19 (coronavirus&#xD;
      disease). The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called BI 767551 helps&#xD;
      people with COVID-19. BI 767551 is an antibody against the coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 2 parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 wants to find out the best dose of BI 767551 given as infusion into a vein. It also&#xD;
      tests how BI 767551 is taken up by the body when taken via an inhaler. Participants are put&#xD;
      into 4 groups by chance. Participants get BI 767551 or placebo once.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets a high dose of BI 767551 as an infusion into a vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets a low dose of BI 767551 as an infusion into a vein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets BI 767551 via an inhaler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 group gets placebo both as an infusion into a vein and via an inhaler&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo infusion and inhaler look like the BI 767551 infusion and inhaler but do not&#xD;
      contain any medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors check how BI 767551 reduces the amount of coronavirus. Once the best dose of BI&#xD;
      767551 is found, part 2 of the study tests BI 767551 in a larger group of people. Also, in&#xD;
      part 2, the participants get BI 767551 or placebo as an infusion into a vein once. In this&#xD;
      part, doctors will check how many people need to be treated in a hospital or die. The results&#xD;
      will be compared between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each part, participants are in the study for about 13 weeks. During this time, they visit&#xD;
      the study site about 8 times and get about 3 remote visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects&#xD;
      of BI 767551.&#xD;
