      . This is a prospective cohort study, observational, multicentre, single-arm,&#xD;
      post-registration to assess the safety of the Adsorbed COVID-19 (Inactivated) Vaccine Sinovac&#xD;
      / Institute Butantan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The immunization schedule is two doses intramuscular injections (deltoid) with a 14-28&#xD;
           days interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There will be 900 participants (300 health care professionals between 18 and 59 years&#xD;
           old); 300 participants 75 years old or more; 300 participants between 60 and 74 years&#xD;
           old. All participants must be allowed to receive the Adsorbed COVID-19 (inactivated)&#xD;
           Vaccine according to the Brazilian Immunization National Plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For safety analysis , the incidence of adverse events after receiving the Adsorbed&#xD;
           COVID-19 (inactivated) Vaccine that needed health assistance until 42 days after&#xD;
           two-doses immunization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The total period of participation in the study will be approximately 60 days after&#xD;
           completing the two-dose schedule of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active pharmacovigilance studies are essential to assess the safety profile of the&#xD;
           vaccine in subgroups that will be included as target populations in the Immunization&#xD;
           Program.&#xD;
