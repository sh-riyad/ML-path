  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test is a bioassay intended for rapid point-of-care detection of&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Performance of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test assay will be assessed&#xD;
      by comparison to a reference method.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical performance of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test was evaluated in a prospective&#xD;
      clinical study conducted at a single (1) CLIA waiver investigational site in Miami, Florida,&#xD;
      U.S. Consenting patients of any age, gender, or race/ethnicity who presented at the test site&#xD;
      with COVID-19 like symptoms during the 2021 COVID-19 season were sequentially enrolled and&#xD;
      tested. Five (5) minimally trained operators with little laboratory experience and who&#xD;
      received no training on use of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid test and were, therefore,&#xD;
      representative of the intended users performed the study test evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject's participation in this study will consist of a single visit. Following the&#xD;
      completion of the informed consent process and a review of Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to&#xD;
      determine eligibility, each subject will receive a unique study identification number.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The purpose of this study is to validate the performance of the SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Test bioassay for rapid detection of infection when using a nasopharyngeal swab. A prospective randomized and blinded study to evaluate a rapid point of care bioassay for the detection of virus particles compared with the currently validated RT-PCR detection standard. Nasopharyngeal samples will be collected along with the current standard of care collection.</intervention_model_description>
