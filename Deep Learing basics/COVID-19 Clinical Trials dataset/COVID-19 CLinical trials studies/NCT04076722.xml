  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are repeatedly shown to predict negative biopsychosocial&#xD;
      health outcomes, including obesity. High rates of ACEs in communities are often paralleled by&#xD;
      high obesity rates, and higher ACEs, such as child abuse, have been shown to positively&#xD;
      predict later obesity and use of unhealthy weight control behaviors. Thus, in light of the&#xD;
      high prevalence of and potential causal links between early-life stress and obesity, there is&#xD;
      a critical need to further explore the ACEs-obesity relationship in order to understand and&#xD;
      to improve obesity outcomes. Given the adverse impact of ACEs and obesity on brain health,&#xD;
      two potential high impact treatment targets of the ACEs-obesity relationship will be explored&#xD;
      in the proposed pilot study: 1) markers of neurocognition (i.e., executive function; EF) and,&#xD;
      2) brain health/plasticity (i.e., neurotrophins like brain-derived neurotropic factor; BDNF&#xD;
      and glial cell derived neurotrophic factor; GDNF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, this trial will be the first to 1) Identify whether brain markers of neural&#xD;
      health (e.g., neurotrophins) are related to ACES and/or neurocognitive EF performance, and 2)&#xD;
      Test whether neuronal or glial neurotrophins predict or change in response to weight loss.&#xD;
      Addressing these two needs advances the science of whether ACEs and EF levels are&#xD;
      differentially related to brain indices of neural and glial health/plasticity. Results of&#xD;
      this pilot may identify a neural substrate and/or profile by which ACEs promote obesity that&#xD;
      may ultimately be more amenable to pharmacologic intervention in order to promote weight loss&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group-treatment trial will assess 48 obese adults randomized to either an 8-week&#xD;
      behavioral weight loss treatment group (n=24) or a wait list control (n=24). Our primary&#xD;
      endpoints are percent reductions in body weight and changes in neurotrophins (e.g., BDNF,&#xD;
      GDNF). Weight and blood specimens will be assessed at baseline, post-treatment (8-weeks), and&#xD;
      follow-up (12-weeks). In testing these endpoints, we will meet the following aims: 1) To test&#xD;
      whether neurotrophins are related to ACEs and executive function (EF), and 2) To test if&#xD;
      neurotrophins predict or change in response to weight loss trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ****The above description describes the study design that was terminated prematurely due to&#xD;
      Covid-19. The following description is the modified protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment described above was canceled and the present study focused on the baseline&#xD;
      visit. In this visit, participants participated in a stress reactivity protocol, so instead&#xD;
      of looking at change in BDNF, GDNF, and inflammatory markers after weight loss treatment, we&#xD;
      looked at change in BDNF, GDNF, and inflammatory markers after the stress activity task. This&#xD;
      information will tell us about how ACEs status is related to these biomarkers at baseline and&#xD;
      in response to stress.&#xD;

      test whether neurotrophins are related to ACEs and executive function (EF), and Aim 2: To&#xD;
      test if neurotrophins predict or change in response to weight loss trajectory. To ensure the&#xD;
      success of the trial, we have assembled a team of experts in adult behavioral obesity&#xD;
      treatment (PI: Hawkins, PhD), neurotrophins (Consultant: Vasquez, PhD), and biostatistics&#xD;
      (Consultant: Washburn, PhD). The results of this study will advance the science of&#xD;
      neurocognitive risk of weight loss difficulties and their potential treatment. Our approach&#xD;
      ensures that the neurocognitive testing and weight loss protocol can be delivered by trained&#xD;
      non-experts, improving its scalability and future dissemination potential. The results could&#xD;
      ultimately be used to tailor weight loss treatments such that neurocognitive risk factors&#xD;
      related to ACES are identified early and may ultimately be proactively mitigated early in&#xD;
      treatment to maximize participants' lasting weight loss outcomes.&#xD;
