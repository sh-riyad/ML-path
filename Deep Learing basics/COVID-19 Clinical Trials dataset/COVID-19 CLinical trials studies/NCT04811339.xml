  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CDC and WHO have deemed the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic of unprecedented severity in&#xD;
      modern times. In 2019, this novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged from the Asian continent and&#xD;
      has now caused upwards of 1million deaths and over 6 million infections globally. Currently,&#xD;
      the estimated global economic impact is over 5 Trillion dollars. Understanding the host&#xD;
      response to pathogens, specifically the cellular and humoral responses, has played an&#xD;
      important role in new non-antibiotic therapies. Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) has a&#xD;
      potential role in the clearance and/or recurrence of enteric viral infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Readily available over-the-counter (OTC) medication for symptomatic relief and appropriate&#xD;
      oral hydration can be health saving measures of great convenience for those affected by&#xD;
      enteric bacterial and viral infections. BSS is a non-proprietary monograph product that is&#xD;
      available in the USA and abroad, over-the-counter (OTC). Of all OTC medications for&#xD;
      traveller's diarrhea (TD), bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) has the greatest antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity against pathogenic bacteria .BSS has also exhibited significant inhibition on viral&#xD;
      invasion of host cells and viral efficacy. Both BSS and bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl, which is&#xD;
      formed in the stomach after ingestion of BSS) at low concentration (0.004-0.13mg/mL)&#xD;
      significantly reduced NoV RNA levels, suggesting an in vivo antiviral mechanism. BSS has also&#xD;
      been shown to have antiviral activity since it inhibited replication of 4 strains of&#xD;
      rotavirus in tissue culture cells and caused a dose-dependent reduction in the growth of&#xD;
      several enteric viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, BSS has been indicated and effectively used for the treatment of TD or enteric&#xD;
      infection, mainly when vomiting occurs. Although the safety and efficacy of BSS is well&#xD;
      known, some of the research done with BSS resides within the industry and have not been&#xD;
      published. We have recently completed an extensive meta-analysis using unpublished clinical&#xD;
      studies regarding BSS safety and efficacy. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trials were performed with studies specifically designed to capture prevention of&#xD;
      manifestation and relief of diarrhea.&#xD;
