      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) as a 2-dose schedule, in adult participants during the&#xD;
      second and/or third trimester of pregnancy and (potentially) post-partum; to assess the&#xD;
      humoral immune response in peripheral blood of adult participants, to Ad26.COV2.S&#xD;
      administered IM as a 2-dose schedule during the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy,&#xD;
      28 days after the first and second vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increased risk of severe coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy, as&#xD;
      well as an increased risk of adverse birth outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in adult participants in&#xD;
      the second and/or third trimester of pregnancy. Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26COVS1) is a&#xD;
      monovalent vaccine composed of a recombinant, replication incompetent adenovirus type 26&#xD;
      (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein. For adult participants, the total study duration from&#xD;
      screening until the last follow-up visit will be approximately 16 months (depending on the&#xD;
      gestational age at enrollment and if the second dose of vaccine will need to be administered&#xD;
      post-partum). The study will consist of a screening phase (28 days), vaccination phase (3&#xD;
      months) and a follow up phase (up to 12 months post-partum [PP]). For neonates/infants (born&#xD;
      to adult participants who received vaccination) the total study duration from birth until the&#xD;
      last follow-up visit will be approximately 12 months. Safety assessments will include&#xD;
      immunogenicity assessments, physical examination, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory&#xD;
      assessments, medical, obstetric and delivery history, neonate safety assessment, adverse&#xD;
      events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;

    <time_frame>7 days after each vaccination (Up to Day 64)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Solicited local AEs are pre-defined local (at the injection site) AEs for which participants are specifically asked and which are noted by participants in their reactogenicity diary for 7 days post each vaccination. Solicited local AEs are: injection site pain/tenderness, erythema, swelling at the vaccination site.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. Participants will be instructed on how to note signs and symptoms in the diary on a daily basis for 7 days post-vaccination (Day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) for solicited systemic AEs. Solicited systemic events include fatigue, headache, nausea and myalgia.</description>
