    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study aims to characterise outcomes for patients treated on an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 in England and Wales, one year after discharge from&#xD;
      hospital. Outcomes will be compared with patients admitted as an emergency to an ICU for&#xD;
      other conditions. The study will use existing national audit data linked to routine&#xD;
      healthcare datasets.&#xD;
