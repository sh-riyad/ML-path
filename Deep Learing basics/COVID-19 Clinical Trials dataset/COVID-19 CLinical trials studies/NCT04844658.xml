  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NASAFYTOL® on COVID-19&#xD;
      positive hospitalized patients as a supportive treatment to standard-of-care in improving&#xD;
      clinical parameters safely during hospital admission (maximum 14 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a standard-of-care comparative, open, parallel two-arms and randomized trial in&#xD;
      50 adult patients positive to COVID-19 infection and hospitalized. It will be monocentric but&#xD;
      may be extended to several investigation sites (multicentric) depending on the evolution of&#xD;
      the epidemic within the hospitals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 patients (25 per arm) infected with COVID-19 and hospitalized (depending on the progress&#xD;
      of the pandemic and therefore the presence of COVID-19 patients, this number could reach 100&#xD;
      (50 per arm)). The first ten sentinel patients will be monitored at the safety level before&#xD;
      enrolling the rest of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of NASAFYTOL® will be evaluated using the following outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Improvement of clinical condition of the patient defined by the COVID-19 WHO ordinal&#xD;
           Outcomes score. This scale reflects a range from uninfected to dead, where 0 is &quot;no&#xD;
           clinical or virological evidence of infection&quot;, 1 is &quot;no limitation of activities&quot;, 2 is&#xD;
           &quot;limitation of activities&quot;, 3 is &quot;hospitalized, no oxygen therapy&quot;, 4 is &quot;oxygen by mask&#xD;
           or nasal prongs&quot;, 5 is &quot;non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen&quot;, 6 is &quot;intubation&#xD;
           and mechanical ventilation&quot;, 7 is &quot;ventilation + additional organ support - pressors,&#xD;
           RRT (renal replacement therapy), ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)&quot;, and 8 is&#xD;
           &quot;death&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to a 1-point decrease&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Score at 14 days (or at hospital leave if &lt;14 days) post randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration (days) of hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In-hospital mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Temperature (fever):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to resolution of fever for at least 48 hours without antipyretics for 48 hours&#xD;
                - Defined as ≤36.6°C (axilla), ≤37.2°C (oral) or ≤37.8°C (rectal or tympanic)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of participants with normalization at day 14 (or at hospital leave if&#xD;
                &lt;14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Need of oxygen therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Tolerance as defined by the Incidence of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
           (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Compliance using the pill count&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Blood test:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  C-reactive proteins : Time to halving of (or achieve normal ) CRP levels compared&#xD;
                to peak value during trial&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hematological values (included Lymphocyte Count) and others routine laboratory&#xD;
                parameters (LDH, albumin, etc.): Time to normalization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vitamin D serum concentration: comparison of concentration between inclusion and&#xD;
                end of trial and between the 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Optional outcome measures will be perform if data is available from routine practice:&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Blood tests between inclusion and end of trial&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Radiological response - Thoracic CT scan or Chest XR&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Oxygenation PaO2 (partial pressure of oxygen) / FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen, FiO2)&#xD;
           ratio (or P/F ratio) :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to improvement (TBD) in oxygenation for at least 48 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Proportion of participants with normalization at day 14 (or at hospital leave if&#xD;
                &lt;14 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Time until negative RT-PCR&#xD;
