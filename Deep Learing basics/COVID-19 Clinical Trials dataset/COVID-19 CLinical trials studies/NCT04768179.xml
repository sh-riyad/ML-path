  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARSCoV-2),&#xD;
      has become a global pandemic. Fortunately, most of the COVID-19 cases confirmed are&#xD;
      categorized as mild for whom home- based symptomatic management with monitoring of clinical&#xD;
      deterioration is recommended. Despite providing symptomatic management, a therapeutic drug&#xD;
      that would limit the course of infection is greatly needed to stop COVID-19 disease&#xD;
      progression. Considering the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology and the legitimate rash towards&#xD;
      appropriate therapies, our study seeks to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low dose&#xD;
      aspirin and ivermectin combination therapy in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Micro clotting is to date reported as a major cause of death among COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 associated micro clotting results into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
      and death. This micro-clotting cascade supports the potential role of anticoagulants like&#xD;
      aspirin, heparin in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Other areas that could be&#xD;
      considered for potential treatment of COVID-19 include drugs and analogues of drugs that have&#xD;
      demonstrated potential in-vitro and or in-vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2 like&#xD;
      hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir and ivermectin.&#xD;
      Ivermectin has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and inhibition of the&#xD;
      causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) with ability to cause a 5000-fold reduction in viral RNA within&#xD;
      48hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although aspirin and ivermectin do not exhibit any synergistic or potentiation at cellular&#xD;
      level, a clinical additive effect resulting from combination therapy with low dose aspirin&#xD;
      and ivermectin is plausible. There is no documented drug-drug interactions or other&#xD;
      biological basis that contra-indicate co-administration of low dose aspirin and ivermectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose, to explore the clinical use of combination anticoagulant: lower dose&#xD;
      aspirin and the FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug: ivermectin, in treatment of COVID-19&#xD;
      patients in an exploratory randomized trial.&#xD;
