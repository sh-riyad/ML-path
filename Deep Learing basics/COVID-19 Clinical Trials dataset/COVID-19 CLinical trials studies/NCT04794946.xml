  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),&#xD;
      had caused widespread impact on health, including substantial mortality among those with&#xD;
      pre-existing health conditions including cirrhosis. Patients with liver cirrhosis are at&#xD;
      increased risk of severe disease and death from the virus infection that causes COVID-19 and&#xD;
      are therefore a priority for immunization, should an efficacious vaccine be developed.&#xD;
      Currently, there are no specific treatments available against COVID-19 and cirrhosis patients&#xD;
      are a priority group for vaccination.&#xD;

      -  Study population: Group 1: Liver Cirrhosis Group 2: Control Group (Healthy controls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: A Phase III, Single Centre, Interventional Study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: 1 year, Enrolment Period: Mar 2021 to Aug 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size with justification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that cirrhosis patients might have lower seroconversion rates than the healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, we assumed that seroconverstion rates 28 days after second dose to be around&#xD;
      65±5%. Sample size needed for a confidence interval of 99.9% is 985. Assuming 10 % dropout&#xD;
      rate, the sample size is around 1100 cirrhosis patients. Similarly 1100 non-cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
           2 IM doses (0.5 mL) of AZD1222(Covishield) at Day 0 and Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring and assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS CoV2 serum IgG Levels and neutralizing antibody titers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and&#xD;
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after&#xD;
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second&#xD;
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Post vaccination will be screened for&#xD;
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by commercially available chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      IgG (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA)on VITROS ECi/ECiQ/3600 automated&#xD;
      instrument. Results will be expressed as reactive with Serum/cut off ratio ≥ 1, and&#xD;
      non-reactive with &lt; 1 S/Co ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All reactive samples will be further processed to measure the neutralizing antibody titer&#xD;
      utilizing a surrogate virus neutralization test ELISA based commercial assay (sVNT)(GenScript&#xD;
      cPass™ SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit) to look for neutralizing antibody&#xD;
      response to the spike protein of the virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real Time PCR for SARS CoV-2 infection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnosis of SARSCoV-2 infection will be confirmed by performance of Real Time reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the combined nasopharyngeal and oral swab&#xD;
      collected in Viral transport medium and by detection of at least 2 specific gene targets of&#xD;
      the SARS CoV-2 virus (E and RdRP genes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary IFN-γ ELISPOT assay. The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4&#xD;
      weeks/28 days after first dose and just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second&#xD;
      dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40&#xD;
      weeks (or 36 weeks after second dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) will be&#xD;
      collected. Primarily, cellular responses will be assessed using an ex-vivo interferon-γ&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) assay to enumerate antigen-specific T cells. In brief,&#xD;
      PBMCs will be isolated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation, immediately&#xD;
      cryopreserved in 90% fetal bovine serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and transferred to liquid&#xD;
      nitrogen for storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IFN-γ ELISPOT assays will be performed using cryopreserved PBMC. Briefly, unfractionated PBMC&#xD;
      will be thawed, resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml in DMEM medium, and will&#xD;
      be plated at 100 μl/well (1 × 105 cells/well) in 96-well, nitrocellulose-backed plates&#xD;
      (Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA) previously coated with a PBS solution of anti-IFN-γ monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (1-D1K, 5 μg/ml; Mabtech Technologies, Nacka, Sweden). Along with negative control&#xD;
      as, different cell stimuli (PMA; phytohemagglutinin 1 μg/ml and Ionomycin ) will be used in&#xD;
      as positive controls., Plates will then incubated at 37°C for 40 h, and then will be&#xD;
      harvested and read in ELISPOT reader. A vaccine-induced response will be defined as a ≥3-fold&#xD;
      increase over the baseline response to the individual epitope peptide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T cells Functionality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and&#xD;
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after&#xD;
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second&#xD;
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Immune response measurements will be&#xD;
      assessed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained at all time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the CD4 and CD8 T cell functionality PBMCs will be cultured in 96 well plate&#xD;
      in RPMI media containing 10% FBS, with or without PMA / Ionomycin (positive control) (PMA 2&#xD;
      ng/mL; ionomycin 1 μg/mL; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and 10 µg /ml LPS (Merck, Darmstadt,&#xD;
      Germany ) at 37°C ,5% CO2 for 6-7 hours. After 1 hour of incubation, 1 μg/mL brefeldin A (BD&#xD;
      Pharmingen, USA) will be added to all the wells. After incubation, cells will be surface&#xD;
      stained for 25-30 minutes with anti-CD3FITC, anti-CD8BV421 and anti-CD4 PE/cyanine5.5 (Cy5)&#xD;
      followed by 10 minutes permeabilization with 100 µL of permeabilising solution( BD&#xD;
      Biosciences, USA) and will be washed twice with 500 µL 1x cytoperm. After washing, cells will&#xD;
      be stained for intracellular expression of IL-2, IFN- γ and IL-17 with anti-IL2 APC,&#xD;
      anti-IFN-γ PE, anti-IL-17 PE- Cy7 (BD Biosciences and Pharmingen, USA) and will be incubated&#xD;
      for 25-30 minutes followed by washing with PBS and fixing the cells in 0.1 % PFA before&#xD;
      acquiring on a BD Verse flow cytometer. Data will be analyzed using FlowJo software version&#xD;
      10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Switching of monocyte Phenotype and functionality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood samples at baseline (pre first dose), day 28 (4 weeks/28 days after first dose and&#xD;
      just before second dose), 8 weeks (or 4 weeks after second dose), 16 weeks (or 12 weeks after&#xD;
      second dose), 28 weeks (or 24 weeks after second dose), 40 weeks (or 36 weeks after second&#xD;
      dose) and 52 weeks ( or 48 weeks after second dose) Vaccine will induce an increase in&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokine production, which is dependent on trained immunity in innate immune&#xD;
      cells. We will characterize the phenotype and functionality of monocytes before vaccination&#xD;
      and after vaccination using flowcytometric analysis.&#xD;
