  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The medical charts of all COVID-19 cases (n=1200) from 17 long-term care facilities in&#xD;
      Montreal, Canada will be reviewed, to compare patients who survived to patients who did not&#xD;
      survive. Through multilevel logistic regression, the risk of death will be estimated for&#xD;
      institutional predictors of mortality, while controlling for individual risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual covariates include clinical features (age, sex, Charlston comorbidity index, SMAF&#xD;
      autonomy score, severity criteria) and medical treatments (IV fluids, anticoagulation,&#xD;
      oxygen, regular opiates, corticosteroids). Aggregate covariates include epidemiological data&#xD;
      (attack rates, timing of outbreak) and institutional characteristics (number of beds, air&#xD;
      exchange per hour, presence of a dedicated COVID-19 unit at the time of outbreak, staff&#xD;
      compliance to infection control measures, staff infection rates, understaffing, proportion of&#xD;
      semi-private rooms, proportion of wandering wards and other special units).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A lot has been written about individual risk factors for COVID-19 death, mostly in the&#xD;
      hospitalized population. However, even though most deaths around the world have occurred&#xD;
      among the frail and elderly, little is known about the risk factors specific to the long-term&#xD;
      care population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective cohort study, the investigators will review the medical charts of all&#xD;
      COVID-19 cases (n=1200) from 17 long-term care facilities in Montreal, Canada, to compare&#xD;
      patients who survived to patients who did not survive. Through multilevel logistic&#xD;
      regression, the risk of death will be estimated for institutional predictors of mortality,&#xD;
      while controlling for individual risk factors. The objective is to influence local and&#xD;
      national policies in long-term care facilities, in the hopes of avoiding the tragic spring&#xD;
      2020 outcomes during subsequent waves of COVID-19 or future pandemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covariates in the models will be drawn from a review of the medical literature and known risk&#xD;
      factors for COVID-19 death. Individual-level covariates include clinical features (age, sex,&#xD;
      Charlston comorbidity index, SMAF autonomy score, severity criteria) as well as medical&#xD;
      treatments (IV fluids, anticoagulation, oxygen, regular opiates, corticosteroids).&#xD;
      Aggregate-level covariates include epidemiological data (attack rates, timing of outbreak)&#xD;
      and institutional characteristics (number of beds, air exchange per hour, presence of a&#xD;
      dedicated COVID-19 unit at the time of outbreak, staff compliance to infection control&#xD;
      measures, staff infection rates, understaffing, proportion of semi-private rooms, proportion&#xD;
      of wandering wards and other special units).&#xD;

        Most of the residents living in the long-term care facilities are elderly and frail, with a&#xD;
        high prevalence of major neurocognitive disorders and low life expectancy. However, some&#xD;
        patients are more robust (e.g. residents of wandering wards) or younger (e.g. residents&#xD;
        with heavy neurological or mental health diagnoses).&#xD;
