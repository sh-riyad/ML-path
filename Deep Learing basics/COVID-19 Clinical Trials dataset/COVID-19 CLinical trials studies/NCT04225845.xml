  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly individuals across the world are increasingly living alone. However, little is known&#xD;
      about the effects of loneliness on economic and health outcomes. The elderly living alone&#xD;
      (i.e., in a household of size 1) will be randomized into one of two cross-randomized&#xD;
      intervention arms or a control condition to improve older individuals' mental wellbeing as&#xD;
      well as ability to cover basic needs, particularly in times of COVID (including health). The&#xD;
      first intervention will focus on improving the elderly's outlook on life and relationships&#xD;
      through problem-solving therapy (PST) delivered over the phone. The second will deliver to&#xD;
      them a one-time cash transfer of Rs.1000, equivalent to the emergency help amount distributed&#xD;
      to ration card holder by the government of Tamil Nadu. Each intervention will be offered on&#xD;
      its own in each of two treatment arms, and in combination in a third. A control group will&#xD;
      receive no intervention. Investigators will track outcomes of the elderly at 1 month, 3&#xD;
      months, and 1 year after the intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>Difficulty in performing daily activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 1 month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked over the last 30 days: how much difficulty they had in sitting for long periods, standing up from sitting down, getting up from lying down, standing for long periods, extending arms above shoulder level, washing whole body, getting dressed, getting to and using the toilet, taking care of household responsibilities, moving inside the home, walking 100 meters, walking long distances (1km), climbing a flight of stairs, stooping or kneeling, picking up things with fingers, carrying things, eating, getting where they want to go, concentrating on something for 10 minutes, learning a new task, and joining community activities. The scale is from 1-5, with 1 being no difficulty, 2 mild, 3 moderate, 4 severe, and 5 cannot do. The response for each activity will be converted to a z-score (subtract mean and divide by the standard deviation) and z-scores will be averaged to generate a composite index.</description>

    <description>The geriatric depression index short form is used. Participants are asked yes/no questions: if they are satisfied with their lives, have dropped activities and interests, feel their life is empty, often get bored, in good spirits most of the time, afraid that something bad is going to happen to them, feel happy most of the time, often feel hopeless, prefer to stay at home, rather than going out and doing new things, have problems with memory, think it is wonderful to be alive, feel worthless, feel full of energy, feel lonely. Responses will be averaged.</description>
