  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the Covid-19 pandemic children has been perceived as a group not being especially&#xD;
      affected, with less being infected, low symptom burden and low mortality. A small proportion&#xD;
      however develop life-threatening hyperinflammation (mis-c) and at least one Danish child has&#xD;
      died from this condition. Since the fall of 2020 international awareness have been raised by&#xD;
      parents reporting that their children experience gastrointestinal issues, chest pain,&#xD;
      headaches, fatigue, joint/muscle pain, sore throat, dizziness, nausea and fever for months&#xD;
      following covid-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators aim to investigate the proportions of possible long covid in&#xD;
      the 45.000 Danish children that has been tested positive for covid-19. The investigators know&#xD;
      from the Danish Covid-19 surveillance data that 300 has been admitted to the hospital within&#xD;
      the first 2 weeks after diagnosing. However, no knowledge about how many visits the&#xD;
      participants have to the ER and GP compared to children without covid-19 as well as hospital&#xD;
      admissions within the first year and medical prescriptions within the first year. This&#xD;
      knowledge can give the investigators an indication of how affected these children are on the&#xD;
      long term. Furthermore, data has been collected about the long-term symptoms in adults, but&#xD;
      not children, and it now seems obvious that this data are needed to fully understand the&#xD;
      disease and orchestra the relevant medical attention for children during the covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 1 Objective: to describe whether there is a difference in the number of visits to general&#xD;
      practitioner, emergency department and hospitalizations in children with and without COVID.&#xD;
      In addition, which co-morbid diagnoses are given 3,6,9 and 12 months after diagnosis with&#xD;
      COVID and which drugs are prescribed. Thirdly, we want to identify the number of contacts to&#xD;
      the general practitioner, emergency department, hospitalizations and prescribed drugs in&#xD;
      children with COVID compared with adults with and without COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP 2 Objective: to investigate long covid symptoms after 3,6,9 and 12 months in children&#xD;
      tested positive for COVID compared to children with a negative test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: National register study and questionnaire survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1: To determine the difference in number of contacts to the general practitioner, emergency&#xD;
      departments and hospitalizations in both children and adults with and without covid-19, an&#xD;
      identification from Covid-19 data linked with LPR3 and SSR will occur. Identification of&#xD;
      co-morbidities will be identified from LPR3 and prescribed drugs are available from LMDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2: Long-term covid-19 symptoms in children will be identified from questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP1: Multiple regressions models presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (CI) will be used to examine the differences in contacts regarding the general practitioner,&#xD;
      emergency departments, hospitalizations, co-morbidities and prescribed drugs in children and&#xD;
      adults with and without COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WP2: To investigate parent and child reported long COVID symptoms numbers and percentages&#xD;
      will be presented follow by multiple logistic models offered as OR and 95% CI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses will be stratified by age groups and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure: To be identified as an exposure for the current study, children from 0-18 years&#xD;
      with at least one positive COVID test will be identified from Covid-19 data from January 2020&#xD;
      until the last updated version. To be able to identify the parents who will receive the&#xD;
      questionnaires the investigators will also need CPR-data on the children's parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-exposure: Children from 0-18 years with COVID negative test for the entire period of&#xD;
      January 2020 until the last updated version will be identified from Covid-19 data. Adults&#xD;
      with and without COVID will as well be identified from Covid-19 data in the same period. To&#xD;
      be able to identify the parents who will receive the questionnaires the investigators will&#xD;
      need CPR-data on the parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Covid-19 data will enable information on children and adults with and without symptoms of&#xD;
      COVID. The parents who will receive questionnaires will also be identified from this register&#xD;
      likewise will data on death, sex and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Temporary Danish National Patient Register (LPR3) will provide data on the number of&#xD;
      emergency visits, hospitalizations and co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Health Insurance Register (SSR) offers numbers of contacts with the general&#xD;
      practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Danish Medicines Registry (LMDB) enables the investigators to link prescribed drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All registers will be updated monthly by The Danish Health Authorities and the investigators&#xD;
      will need data extraction in the period 2020 until the last updated version from all the&#xD;
      above mentioned registers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications of results&#xD;
&#xD;
      All results will be published in international scientist journals as well as the hospital&#xD;
      webpage and press releases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be the largest investigation of long covid in children to date. Denmark has&#xD;
      excellent registers and logistics for questionnaires providing a unique opportunity to report&#xD;
      on children's health care seeking behavior and symptoms after being infected with covid-19.&#xD;
      Children are an overlooked group during the pandemic and these data will provide essential&#xD;
      information for health care staff, politicians and parents.&#xD;
