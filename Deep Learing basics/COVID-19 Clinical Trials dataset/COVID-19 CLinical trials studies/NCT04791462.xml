  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the coronavirus pandemic has spread rapidly around the world, it has generated a&#xD;
      considerable degree of fear, concern and anxiety among the population in general and among&#xD;
      certain groups in particular, such as older persons. Initial findings from studies in China&#xD;
      indicated the presence of moderate to severe psychological impact in a significant proportion&#xD;
      of individuals and an increased prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. It should also&#xD;
      be noted that other types of symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, appeared to persist&#xD;
      over time and to a greater extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis can develop in any joint, but most often affects the knees, hands and hips.&#xD;
      People with osteoarthritis are often older and sometimes more frail than the general&#xD;
      population. The main recommendations for non-drug treatment of osteoarthritis include&#xD;
      education, physical activity and structured exercise programmes with or without weight&#xD;
      reduction. Due to the confinement associated with COVID-19, many patients have had to stop&#xD;
      exercise/physical activity and postpone prosthetic surgery. Apart from the context of delay&#xD;
      in surgery, there is little data available on the impact of the pandemic on people with&#xD;
      arthritis. Several questions are therefore still pending concerning the impact of the&#xD;
      pandemic on these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the following therapeutic modalities have been disrupted&#xD;
      during this period: access to care, scheduling of prosthetic surgery, consumption of&#xD;
      painkillers or NSAIDs, recourse to physical activities, recourse to physiotherapy sessions,&#xD;
      weight changes, level of pain.... Our objective is to evaluate the physical, social,&#xD;
      psychological and behavioural consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients.&#xD;
