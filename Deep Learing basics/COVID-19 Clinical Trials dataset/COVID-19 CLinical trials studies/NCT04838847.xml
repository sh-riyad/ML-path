             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Capable of giving personal signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form and in this study&#xD;

          6. Females: At the time of enrollment, negative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)&#xD;
             pregnancy test (serum) for women presumed to be of childbearing potential on the day&#xD;
             of enrollment. On Day 1 (pre-vaccination): negative urine pregnancy test (hCG), (only&#xD;
             required if serum pregnancy test was performed more than 3 days before).&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Women that are postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for ≥ 12 consecutive months&#xD;
             prior to screening [Day 1]) or permanently sterilized will be considered as not having&#xD;
             reproductive potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Females of childbearing potential must use highly effective of birth control from 1&#xD;
             month before the first administration of the trial vaccine until 3 months following&#xD;
             the last administration. The following methods of birth control are considered highly&#xD;
             effective when used consistently and correctly:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or transdermal);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation&#xD;
                  (oral, injectable or implantable);&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Bilateral tubal occlusion;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vasectomized partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Same sex relationships.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Sexual abstinence (periodic abstinence [e.g., calendar, ovulation symptothermal and&#xD;
        post-ovulation methods]) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant ill or febrile (body temperature ≥38.0°C) within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
             screening and/or symptoms suggestive of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) within the&#xD;
             past 14 days prior to screening (ill or febrile participants may be re-scheduled&#xD;
             within the predefined interval when no longer presenting symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Previous or currently active SARS-CoV-2 infection (currently as confirmed by reactive&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or positive serology test prior to the first trial&#xD;
             vaccine administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of any investigational or non-registered product (vaccine or drug) other than the&#xD;
             trial vaccine within 28 days preceding the administration of the trial vaccine, or&#xD;
             planned use during the trial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Receipt of any other vaccines within 14 days (for inactivated vaccines) or 28 days&#xD;
             (for live vaccines) prior to enrollment in this trial or planned receipt of any&#xD;
             vaccine within 28 days of trial vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Receipt of any investigational or licensed/authorized SARS-CoV-2 or other coronavirus&#xD;
             vaccine, including non-specific vaccines such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, prior to&#xD;
             the administration of the trial vaccine or planned administration during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any treatment with immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs (including, but&#xD;
             not limited to, corticosteroids, biologicals and Methotrexate) for &gt; 14 days total&#xD;
             within 6 months preceding the administration of trial vaccine or planned use during&#xD;
             the trial. For corticosteroid use, this means prednisone or equivalent, 0.5 mg/kg/day&#xD;
             for 14 days or more. The use of inhaled, topical, or localized injections of&#xD;
             corticosteroids (e.g., for joint pain/inflammation) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. History of potential immune-mediated disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of angioedema.&#xD;

         14. Administration of immunoglobulins (Igs) and/or any blood products within the 3 months&#xD;
             preceding the administration of any dose of the trial vaccine or planned&#xD;
             administration during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Participants with a significant acute or chronic medical or psychiatric illness that,&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Investigator, precludes trial participation (e.g., may increase&#xD;
             the risk of trial participation, render the participant unable to meet the&#xD;
             requirements of the trial, or may interfere with the participant's trial evaluations).&#xD;
             These include severe and/or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal&#xD;
             disease, liver disease, renal disease, respiratory disease, endocrine disorder, and&#xD;
             neurological and psychiatric illnesses. However, those with controlled and stable&#xD;
             cases can be included in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Foreseeable non-compliance with protocol as judged by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;

             coagulopathy or platelet disorder) or prior history of significant bleeding or&#xD;
             bruising following intramuscular (IM) injections or venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Participants employed by the Sponsor, Investigator or trial site, or relatives of&#xD;
             research staff working on this trial.&#xD;

             judicial or the administrative authorities).&#xD;
