  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To prevent the spread of COVID-19, states are imposing quarantine measures and sanctions for&#xD;
      all citizens to stay at home as much as possible. These measures severely limit physical&#xD;
      activity. It is known that physical activity is an important preventive approach for many&#xD;
      preventable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases. Restriction of physical activity,&#xD;
      loss of usual routine, and reduced social and physical contact with others can cause feelings&#xD;
      of distress, disappointment, and isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the latest guidelines, increasing physical activity is recommended to prevent heart rhythm&#xD;
      disorders and contribute to the effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to examine the effect of social isolation on physical activity level,&#xD;
      health literacy, and kinesophobia in heart rhythm disorders.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Level</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020-March 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity level will be evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ-SF). The questionnaire provides information about the time spent on walking and moderate-to-severe / vigorous activities, while also evaluating the time spent sitting (sedentary behavior level). Physical activity levels are classified according to MET-min/week values. According to these values, people are classified as physically inactive (inactive), low level of physical activity (minimally active), and sufficient level of physical activity (very active).</description>

    <measure>Fear of Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020-March 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of movement will be evaluated using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia for Heart. The scale consists of 17 items. The score a participant can get is between 17 and 68. The higher the total score, the higher the severity of kinesiophobia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>June 2020-March 2021</time_frame>
    <description>Health literacy will be evaluated using the Health Literacy Scale. This questionnaire consists of 25 questions and four sub-dimensions. A minimum of 25 and a maximum of 125 points are obtained for the entire scale. The higher the score obtained from the questionnaire, the higher the health literacy level of the participant.</description>
