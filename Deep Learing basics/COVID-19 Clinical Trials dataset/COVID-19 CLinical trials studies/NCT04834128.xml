      A Phase II safety and tolerability study of expanded gamma delta T cell lymphocytes (TCB008)&#xD;
      in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase II study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ex-vivo expanded&#xD;
      gamma delta T-cells (TCB008) manufactured from a single allogeneic unmatched or partially,&#xD;
      randomly matched, unrelated donor, in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to identify an optimal, safe dose of allogeneic γδ T cells in a&#xD;
      population of patients with COVID-19. There will be 4 patient Cohorts. Cohorts 1 - 3 will&#xD;
      receive a pre-defined dosing schedule, with Cohort 4 being treated with a dose selected upon&#xD;
      completion of the first 3 Cohorts. In order to investigate immunogenicity&#xD;
      assessment/sensitisation effects, patients in the expansion cohort who do not experience&#xD;
      adverse reactions meeting dose limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria after the first&#xD;
      administration will receive re-infusion with the same dose on Day 10 after the first&#xD;
      infusion.&#xD;
