    <textblock>
      Because COVID-19 is a new virus, it is believed that awareness assessment will inform and&#xD;
      guide what steps should be taken and which groups should be targeted in terms of controlling&#xD;
      the pandemic. According to our hypothesis, COVID-19 awareness of individuals in different age&#xD;
      groups in the Turkish population also varies. There are controlling pratices based on&#xD;
      scientific studies made during the outbreak, but there is no certainty as to how much these&#xD;
      measures are known by our society. Based on these, the aim of our study was to investigate&#xD;
      and compare the awareness of new Coronavirus (COVID-19) in different age groups across&#xD;
      Turkey.&#xD;

      Statistical Analysis: In the statistical analysis of the data obtained at the end of the&#xD;
      study, SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences / SPSS 21.0) was analyzed using the&#xD;
      statistical program. In the study, arithmetic averages are presented with tables and graphs&#xD;
      as mean ± SD (standard deviation) and values indicated by counting in numbers (percent).&#xD;
      Demographic information of the participants and their responses to the questionnaire&#xD;
      questions were evaluated using descriptive statistical analysis method. In the study,&#xD;
      Independent Sample t Test was used in parametric data and ANOVA was used in normal&#xD;
      non-parametric data. In all analyzes, p &lt;0,05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling: Sample size was calculated based on the number of questions asked. Accordingly, the&#xD;
      number of questions multiplied by the formula of 60 is the lower limit (42*60=2520).&#xD;
      Considering the 20% probability of a drop-out and the fact that participants did not want to&#xD;
      volunteer, it was decided to take 3150 people to the study. Consent will be obtained from the&#xD;
      participants through a voluntary information form.&#xD;
