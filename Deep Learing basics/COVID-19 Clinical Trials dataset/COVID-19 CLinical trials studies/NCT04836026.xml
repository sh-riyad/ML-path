  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, innovations for acute kidney injury (AKI) and continuous renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy (CRRT) have centered around an adult population. However, research has shown that&#xD;
      over 10% of pediatric patients develop severe AKI within the first week in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU). When a pediatric patient requires renal replacement therapy for AKI in the ICU,&#xD;
      CRRT is usually the modality of choice. The HF20™ is indicated for supporting patients&#xD;
      weighing 8 to 20 kilograms, addressing a critical clinical need for critically ill children&#xD;
      who require CRRT. Current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CRRT filters are&#xD;
      designed for patients weighing more than 20 kg or less than 10 kg, leaving a gap in&#xD;
      appropriately designed filters for pediatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous trial in the US showed that the HF20™ is safe and effective, however the membrane&#xD;
      composition of the HF20™ used in that trial is different than what is currently manufacturer&#xD;
      and available. Baxter Healthcare Corporation has received an Emergency Use Authorization&#xD;
      (EUA) for the currently available HF20™ to be used in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      however participants do not need to be infected with the SAR-CoV-2 virus in order to be&#xD;
      treated. The EUA for the HF20™ allows for treatment for any children weighing between 8 and&#xD;
      20 kilograms in need of CRRT. This registry will collect clinical data related to the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the HF20™ filter for CRRT in pediatric patients weighing 8 to 20 kilograms at&#xD;
      participating institutions, however participation in this registry is not a requirement in&#xD;
      order to be treated with the HF20™ filter.&#xD;
