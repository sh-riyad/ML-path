  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inability of the heart to pump out blood to the rest of the body organs is called heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). HF affects almost 920,000 people in the UK, costing the NHS up to £2.33bn/year.&#xD;
      Physical exercise programmes aiming to improve the heart's ability to pump out blood are used&#xD;
      to a) reduce the risk of life-threatening events (e.g., heart attack), b) reduce admissions&#xD;
      to hospital and c) improve individual's physical independence (e.g., walking unsupported,&#xD;
      being able toperform daily essential activities). However, these physical exercise programmes&#xD;
      have been cut short under the current COVID-19 pandemic, with support in most UK regions&#xD;
      being restricted to online videos and advice. With many people with HF being asked to be&#xD;
      &quot;shielded&quot; or &quot;self-isolate&quot; for an unknown duration, it is important to develop a reliable&#xD;
      and cost-effective physical exercise service to support this clinical group. The research&#xD;
      team has developed a novel physical exercise programme, fully-delivered online. Before&#xD;
      assessing if it could improve clinical outcomes (e.g., heart's ability to pump out blood) and&#xD;
      how cost-effective it could be, a 10-month pilot study is proposed that will assess if the&#xD;
      proposed online physical exercise programme could be performed in people with HF. Thirty&#xD;
      participants will be allocated at random into two groups: Group A will receive up to 24&#xD;
      exercise sessions and up-to 3 lifestyle workshops, in addition to usual care over a 2-month&#xD;
      period. Group B will receive a self-care exercise programme (≥3 sessions per week) for a&#xD;
      two-month period in addition to usual care. Prior to the group random allocation, online&#xD;
      assessments will be performed including demographics and clinical history, the ability to&#xD;
      perform daily activities, sedentary or physical activity habits and quality of life. The&#xD;
      assessments including interviews to assess participant's experiences will be repeated at 2&#xD;
      months&#xD;

    <description>Group A participants will be invited to attend up to 24 exercise sessions (2 sessions per week and a 3rd optional) and 2 virtual (online; a 3rd will be optional) HF workshops over 8 weeks. All sessions will be delivered via online platforms, with 1 facilitator supporting up to 8 participants simultaneously in each session.</description>

    <description>Group B participants will be provided with a self-care exercise programme. The exercise programme will be home-based with a mixture of online video calls and telephone support contacts, alternating once every other week. The video or telephone contacts will be mutually agreed by the patient and the facilitator at a mutually convenient time and will aim to support Group B participants, by offering advice and tracking progress. Patients will be provided with two exercise programmes: I) a chair-based exercise programme (DVD will be provided), and ii) a progressive walking training programme (a manual will be provided). Patients will be advised to exercise ≥3 times per week, starting from their own personal level and gradually building up over 8 weeks in session's duration, frequency of sessions per week, and walking pace.</description>
