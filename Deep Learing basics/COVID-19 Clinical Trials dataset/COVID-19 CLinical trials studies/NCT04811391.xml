    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine in&#xD;
      hospital based HWs in Albania. This will answer critical questions about the real-world&#xD;
      performance of COVID-19 vaccines in one of the key target groups for vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a prospective one-year cohort study of hospital-based health workers&#xD;
      in Albania to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID -19 disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic hospital&#xD;
      health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection will be diagnosed using symptom questionnaires and PCR testing.&#xD;
      Additionally, serology testing will be obtained over the course of one year, to identify&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections.&#xD;
