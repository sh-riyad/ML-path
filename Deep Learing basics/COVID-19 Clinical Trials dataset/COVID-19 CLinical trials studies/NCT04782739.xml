  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic and response are likely to lead to severe unintended consequences for&#xD;
      the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV and syphilis. Zimbabwe has made&#xD;
      huge progress in coverage of antenatal testing of HIV and syphilis, which reached 98% and 91%&#xD;
      in 2019, and is aiming for dual elimination. However, there is emerging evidence of&#xD;
      disruption to health services due to COVID-19, similar to that seen in prior epidemics, which&#xD;
      may reverse this progress. Mathematical modelling has estimated 3 and 6 month interruptions&#xD;
      to ART supply would lead to 1.67 and 2.07 times more babies being born with HIV in SSA over&#xD;
      the next year respectively. This study aims to provide real-world data to understand the&#xD;
      effects of COVID-19 on the provision and uptake of PMTCT services. Our study has five&#xD;
      objectives. Firstly, to conduct a retrospective analysis of national data routinely collected&#xD;
      by healthcare facilities to explore changes before, during and after the pandemic in key&#xD;
      indicators related to antenatal testing and treatment of HIV and syphilis, and management of&#xD;
      HIV-exposed and infected infants. Secondly, data on neonates admitted to Sally Mugabe Central&#xD;
      Hospital, already collected for the NeoTree study, will be analysed to explore the impact of&#xD;
      COVID-19 on the number of HIV-exposed infants hospitalised, their clinical status at&#xD;
      presentation and outcomes. Thirdly, qualitative studies with mothers and healthcare workers&#xD;
      will explore barriers to optimal engagement with care and provision of PMTCT services&#xD;
      respectively. Fourthly, quantitative results on testing and ART provision will be used to&#xD;
      model the impact of disruptions on the rate of PMTCT of HIV enabling policy makers to plan&#xD;
      for subsequent waves of COVID-19 and future epidemics. Finally, educational materials will be&#xD;
      developed, piloted and disseminated during the project to provide information to pregnant&#xD;
      women on safe access to PMTCT services.&#xD;
