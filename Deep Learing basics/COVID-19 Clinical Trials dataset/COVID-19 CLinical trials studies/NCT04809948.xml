    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify adverse events following vaccination by the COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine by evaluating adverse side effects, hematological values; immunogenicity in the&#xD;
      Egyptian candidates in response to COVID-19 vaccine, summarizing the which may occur&#xD;
      following administration of COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infectious disease caused by&#xD;
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that had infected more than 100&#xD;
      million individuals and caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide by February 13, 2021. A&#xD;
      safe and effective vaccination trials against COVID-19 is urgently needed. There are&#xD;
      currently more than 160 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in development worldwide, and 25 are in&#xD;
      different phases of clinical trials using different platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and immunogenicity of vaccines varies depending on the study cohort. Race and&#xD;
      ethnicity were shown to affect the antibody responses to the rubella vaccine, which elicited&#xD;
      significantly higher titers in children of African ethnicity compared to those of European&#xD;
      descent or Hispanic ethnicity, likely, disparities in serologic responses to vaccines were&#xD;
      also observed between different ethnic groups for the Haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus&#xD;
      toxoid conjugate vaccine , or the Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide-Neisseria&#xD;
      meningitidis outer membrane protein conjugate vaccine . thus keeping the race an important&#xD;
      factor in studding its effect on immunogenicity of vaccine. Thus keeping the race an&#xD;
      important factor in studding its effect on immunogenicity of vaccine, which pushed us to&#xD;
      estimate immunogenicity in Egyptian population after vaccination with the inactivated&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heamatological changes after vaccination had been detected in many researches; lecuocytosis&#xD;
      was found shortly after vaccination of infants, which was primarily a neutrophilia but no&#xD;
      participant received antibiotics and all remained well at follow-up . In a case series study,&#xD;
      also leukocytosis with fever was detected following pneumococcal vaccine administration . On&#xD;
      the other hand, neutropenia was detected following a new vaccine against Shigella sonnei .&#xD;
      Platelets abnormalities also had been detected following vaccination, a previous example is&#xD;
      idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, linked to the administration of measles-containing&#xD;
      vaccines .&#xD;
