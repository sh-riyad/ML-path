    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of leronlimab (PRO 140)&#xD;
      administered as weekly subcutaneous injections in subjects experiencing prolonged symptoms (&gt;&#xD;
      12 weeks) of COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, two-arm, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled multicenter study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of leronlimab (PRO 140) in patients with prolonged symptoms&#xD;
      caused by COVID-19. Patients will be randomized to receive weekly doses of 700 mg leronlimab&#xD;
      (PRO 140), or placebo. Leronlimab (PRO 140) and placebo will be administered via subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three phases: Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-Up Period.&#xD;
      Total study duration is 91 days. The study will be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United&#xD;
      States and planned number of subjects are 50 subjects.&#xD;
