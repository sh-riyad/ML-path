  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether continuous heart rate obtained from&#xD;
      wearable devices and self-reported data from surveys and symptom logs alongside saliva&#xD;
      samples can be used to help students self-monitor for infection and eventually be able to&#xD;
      create a predictive model to detect infection or illness early.&#xD;

      During this study, participants will be asked to; Provide a baseline self-collected saliva&#xD;
      sample, download and use the suite of apps (e.g., Fitbit, Social Rhythms, Roadmap 2.0) and&#xD;
      answer surveys that are delivered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at 4 time points (e.g.,&#xD;
      baseline, 1-month, 2-month, 3-month [end of academic semester]). You will wear a non-invasive&#xD;
      health sensor watch (Fitbit) for up to one academic year and interact with the positive&#xD;
      activity and circadian rhythms and fitness apps. We will provide you with &quot;kits&quot; to collect&#xD;
      saliva specimens at your home once at baseline. Lastly, you will also take a longer baseline&#xD;
      (first) survey and complete an end of month survey regarding your mental well-being (3 total,&#xD;
      one each month for a total of 4 months), there will also be an exit survey about your&#xD;
      thoughts about COVID-19 and participating in the study at the end of the study.&#xD;
