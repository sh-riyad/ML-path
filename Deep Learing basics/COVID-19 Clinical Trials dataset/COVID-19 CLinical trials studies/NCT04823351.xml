      Recent results demonstrated an increased risk of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers&#xD;
      (HCW), particularly when access to personal protective equipment (PPE) was inadequate. (ref).&#xD;
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to PPE has become complicated by a surge in worldwide&#xD;
      demand combined with production limitations and logistical barriers. Since their introduction&#xD;
      in hospitals in the 1990s, filtering facepiece (FFP) masks, mostly of the FFP2 type, are used&#xD;
      by HCWs to protect themselves against bioaerosols due to tuberculosis, measles, and selected&#xD;
      respiratory viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked debate around reasonable and safe use&#xD;
      of the different types of face masks to protect the HCWs who provide direct care for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients. At the heart of the discussion are the respective contributions to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      transmissions by droplets and aerosols, and the corresponding risk levels resulting in&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to perform a cluster-randomized, parallel, controlled, non-inferiority study&#xD;
      among Swiss nursing and retirement homes to evaluate the efficacy of surgical masks vs. FFP2&#xD;
      masks during patient care and prospectively observe possible infections amongst both&#xD;
      vaccinated and unvaccinated staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff in nursing homes will be randomized to use either surgical or FFP2 masks for patient&#xD;
      care consistently. Considering an attack rate of 0.8% over three months among healthcare&#xD;
      workers, a non-inferiority margin of 5%, and an intracluster variability of 0.01, - we&#xD;
      require a minimum of 625 participants per group. The COVID-19 attack rate will be tested by&#xD;
      initial serology testing and weekly pooled saliva specimen for SARS-CoV-2 testing.&#xD;
      (Re)-Infections will be tracked by weekly pooled saliva-based PCR testing. Exposure to&#xD;
      COVID-19 other than during work time will be explored by questionnaires and focus group&#xD;

      1. Project summary Recent results demonstrated an increased risk of COVID-19 infection&#xD;
           among healthcare workers (HCW), particularly when access to personal protective&#xD;
           equipment (PPE) was inadequate. (ref) During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to PPE has&#xD;
           become complicated by a surge in worldwide demand combined with production limitations&#xD;
           and logistical barriers. Since their introduction in hospitals in the 1990s, filtering&#xD;
           facepiece (FFP) masks, mostly of the FFP2 type, are used by HCWs to protect themselves&#xD;
           against bioaerosols due to tuberculosis, measles, and selected respiratory viruses. The&#xD;
           COVID-19 pandemic has sparked debate around reasonable and safe use of the different&#xD;
           types of face masks to protect the HCWs who provide direct care for COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
           At the heart of the discussion is whether droplets or aerosols transmit SARS-CoV-2, and&#xD;
           which of the two is responsible for what risk level of SARS-CoV-2 transmission resulting&#xD;
           in disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective is to perform a cluster-randomized, parallel, controlled, non-inferiority&#xD;
           study among Swiss nursing and retirement homes (homes) to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
           surgical masks vs. FFP2 masks during patient care and prospectively observe possible&#xD;
           infections amongst both vaccinated and unvaccinated staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Staff in nursing homes will be randomized to use either surgical or FFP2 masks for&#xD;
           patient care consistently. Considering an attack rate of 0.8%[1] over three months among&#xD;
           healthcare workers, a non-inferiority margin of 5%, and an intracluster variability of&#xD;
           0.01,[2] - we require a minimum of 625 participants per group.[3] The COVID-19 attack&#xD;
           rate will be tested by initial serology testing and weekly pooled saliva specimen for&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 testing. (Re)-Infections will be tracked by weekly pooled Saliva based PCR&#xD;
           testing. Exposure to COVID-19 other than during work time will be explored by&#xD;
           questionnaires and focus group discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study protocol 2.1 State of research in the field 2.1.1 Transmission of COVID-19 by&#xD;
           droplets or aerosols Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 110 million&#xD;
           cases were confirmed with almost 2.4 million deaths as of February 22nd, 2020. Given&#xD;
           that SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, its spread is expected to occur mainly by&#xD;
           droplets (diameter &gt;5µm) and via contact; however, laboratory tests suggest that&#xD;
           SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable and infectious also in aerosols (diameter &lt;5 µm).1,2. Both&#xD;
           droplets and aerosols are naturally produced by humans when breathing, talking,&#xD;
           coughing, or sneezing. A cough and a sneeze can generate between 3000 and 40,000&#xD;
           droplets of diameters between 0.5 to 12 µm, respectively 3-5; furthermore, droplets and&#xD;
           aerosols can both contain SARS-CoV-2 virus if produced by COVID-19 patients. Aerosols&#xD;
           are small-size droplets remaining in the air, and thus may travel beyond 2m from a&#xD;
           source the respiratory tract bypassing surgical masks. Therefore, healthcare workers&#xD;
           have been advised to wear FFP2 masks in procedures that generate aerosols. It remains to&#xD;
           be clarified if surgical masks are inferior to FFP2 masks in the care of COVID-19&#xD;
           patients other than being exposed to aerosol-generating procedures. Recent data suggests&#xD;
           that if worn correctly by both patient and exposed staff, surgical masks are able of&#xD;
           filtering over 90% of particles generated 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifics about COVID-19 disease transmission and infectious dose are currently lacking.&#xD;
      However, numbers in the order of 1000 droplets and more are realistic assumptions.7 The&#xD;
      infection risk by one virus copy in viral shedding is about 1.5×10-6 to 1.6×10-5. Thus the&#xD;
      infection risk due to aerosols at distances larger than 1-2 meters is substantially lower&#xD;
      than that due to close interaction within 1 meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, protection from COVID-19 patients must focus on close interaction where&#xD;
      droplets play a significant role, which could be addressed by wearing a surgical mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added protective benefit of FFP2 masks outside so-called &quot;aerosol-generating procedures&quot;&#xD;
      where aerosols are believed to be produced in large quantities is meager. Thus, recommending&#xD;
      FFP2 masks for non-aerosol-generating procedures with regard to COVID-19 is not justified.&#xD;
      Hence, a randomized trial to test the non-inferiority of surgical masks in COVID-19 care&#xD;
      (other than during aerosol-generating procedures) is ethically sound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With logistical challenges arising to vaccinate the greater public8, many people refusing&#xD;
      vaccinations, a significant percent of the population having contracted COVID-19 since the&#xD;
      beginning of the pandemic, and new mutations emerging with growing amounts of reports of&#xD;
      reinfections,9 we are facing a reality in which, regarding their infection and vaccination&#xD;
      status, non-homogenous groups of people will have to learn to co-exist for months and&#xD;
      possibly years to come.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, there is currently a lot of discordance between hospitals when it comes to&#xD;
      the choice of mask for healthcare workers, making recruitment of sufficient participants&#xD;
      basically impossible. We decided to focus on including retirement homes and homes for the&#xD;
      elderly. The homes have designated wards for COVID-19 and separate wards for patients&#xD;
      requiring aerosol generating procedures. They also require more nursing and support staff to&#xD;
      take care of the elderly, making them ideal candidates for our study design and tracking&#xD;
      infections based on the mask type. In the United States a third of all COVID-19 related&#xD;
      deaths in the United States are believed to be linked to nursing homes10, highlighting the&#xD;
      importance to have unanimous guidelines as to the most important basic measures such as mask&#xD;
      wearing, to reduce infections and mortality across populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.2 Face masks and their appropriate use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different types of face masks are distinguished for patient care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical masks (usually II and IIR) have the main role of limiting the transmission of&#xD;
      infective agents from HCWs to patients, mainly during surgical procedures. In specific&#xD;
      situations such as colonization with multidrug-resistant microorganisms in the respiratory&#xD;
      tract or during outbreaks with respiratory pathogens, wearing them is also recommended for&#xD;
      infected patients as source control to limit transmission. The fitting of these masks is&#xD;
      loose and leakage occurs around the edges of the mask. While IIR masks protect the wearer&#xD;
      from projected splashes of biological fluids, they do not provide the wearer with a reliable&#xD;
      protection level from inhaling smaller airborne particles unless modified by e.g. knotting&#xD;
      the edges. Ref 6&#xD;
&#xD;
      Class 2 filtering facepiece (FFP 2) masks offer respiratory protection for the wearer. They&#xD;
      have tight-fitting and minimal leakage occurs around the edges of the mask. Filtering&#xD;
      facepiece masks were initially intended to protect workers from dust exposure. However, FFP2&#xD;
      masks were introduced to healthcare predominantly to protect healthcare workers exposed to&#xD;
      patients with tuberculosis or measles. (ref) Their appropriate use during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in healthcare units remains controversial, as explained above. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis pooling five randomized-controlled trials showed no difference between surgical&#xD;
      masks and FFP masks for outcomes such as clinical respiratory illness or laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
      influenza. 11 2.2 Aims Primary outcome: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      surgical masks are not inferior to FFP2 masks in patient care (in situations outside of&#xD;
      aerosol-generating procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: By including staff who may have received vaccination we want to track&#xD;
      possible infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster-randomized, parallel, controlled, non-inferiority study among Swiss nursing- and&#xD;
      retirement homes hosting COVID-19 patients will evaluate the benefits of wearing surgical&#xD;
      masks vs. FFP2 masks during COVID-19 patient care (outside aerosol-generating procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.1 Settings: Any Swiss nursing- and retirement home offering COVID-19 care is eligible to&#xD;
      be included. The homes will be recruited through direct contact. Each home will have an&#xD;
      appointed onsite investigator for communication with the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2 Study duration We will recruit homes between January 1 and March 10th. During three&#xD;
      months, the intervention will last until no later than June 30, 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.3.Randomization: Home wards will be computer-randomized before starting the intervention,&#xD;
      stratified by ward size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Interventions include either universal FFP2-masking for every healthcare worker&#xD;
      with patient contact, compared to selective FFP2-masking, which means that FFP2 masks are&#xD;
      worn only during aerosol-generating procedures such as tube manipulation; for all other&#xD;
      procedures, healthcare workers wear a surgical mask of the IIR type. Furthermore, weekly&#xD;
      saliva-based pooling will be conducted to track possible (re)-infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.4 Outcomes: Primary outcomes are new SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers&#xD;
      appointed to deliver care to COVID-19 patients, measured by a baseline seroprevalence testing&#xD;
      and a weekly pooled saliva specimen-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. Secondary outcomes are newly&#xD;
      identified SARS-CoV-2 infections among healthcare workers by rtPCR; questionnaires on monthly&#xD;
      activity for healthcare workers; focus group discussions on workplace vs. private exposure to&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. Serology testing and saliva-based testing for healthcare workers are&#xD;
      voluntary and are performed upon written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.5 Sample collection and laboratory testing: Sample size calculation: We hypothesize an&#xD;
      attack rate of 0.8 % among healthcare workers (0.8% of the participating healthcare workers&#xD;
      become SARS-CoV-2 positive by the end of the study period), the surgical masks are&#xD;
      non-inferior to FFP2 masks by 5%. Considering an attack rate of 0.8 %, an inferiority margin&#xD;
      of 5%, and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, 1250 participants (625 per&#xD;
      group) have to be included (one-sided and with 80% power). The study will be conducted in a&#xD;
      cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.6 Outcome measurements SARS-CoV-2 serology at baseline and weekly saliva-based specimen&#xD;
      pooled SARS-CoV-2 tests. Exposure to COVID-19 patients and risk behavior by questionnaire.&#xD;
      Qualitative interpretation of focus group discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.7 Data analysis A non-inferiority difference of proportions test will model the primary&#xD;
      outcome. Secondary outcomes will be analyzed descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect that selective FFP2-masking is not inferior to universal FFP-2 masking; however,&#xD;
      selecting when and how FFP-2 masks are to be worn by HCWs is not trivial. This project aims&#xD;
      to inform those decisions with improvements in our understanding of the issues involved and&#xD;
      the generation of on-site data to guide decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.5 Project milestones and timeline[15]&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.6 The potential impact of the research Recent research and government regulations6,12 have&#xD;
      shown a significant disparity in opinions regarding the appropriate usage of surgical masks /&#xD;
      FFP2 masks. In light of new regulations enforcing FFP2 mask usage by the general population&#xD;
      in neighboring countries such as Germany and the diverging opinions amongst health care&#xD;
      professionals - we expect this study to help elucidate appropriate use and clear up possible&#xD;
      misconceptions. Given the lack of research in this area, this study's outcome will&#xD;
      potentially have a world-wide public health impact and aid regulatory bodies to make founded&#xD;
      decisions and recommendations to both healthcare workers and the public alike.&#xD;
