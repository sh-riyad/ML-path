    <textblock>
      The public health council (Haut Conseil de Sant√© Publique) published a statement on 14 March&#xD;
      2020 relating to the management of patients with severe forms of COVID-19, stipulating&#xD;
      specific recommendations for patients with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statement notes that patients with cancer at much higher risk (four to five times higher)&#xD;
      of several respiratory complications, which develop very rapidly, especially if they had&#xD;
      recently undergone surgery or chemotherapy in the previous few weeks, and that this risk&#xD;
      could be life-threatening, on top of the cancer-related risk. In addition, the statement&#xD;
      noted that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COVID-19 appears to be more frequent in patients with cancer than among the general&#xD;
           population (1% vs 0.29%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Among those infected, the risk of severe respiratory complications requiring admission&#xD;
           to the intensive care unit (ICU) is higher in patients with cancer than among those&#xD;
           without (39% vs 8%, P=0.0003).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A history of chemotherapy or surgery in the previous months is an important prognostic&#xD;
           factor for the development of severe respiratory complications (odds ratio (OR) = 5.34,&#xD;
           P= 0.0026).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deterioration of respiratory function occurs more quickly in patients with cancer (13 vs&#xD;
           43 days, hazard ratio (HR) 3.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.65-7.69]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, COVID-19 may lead to a change in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of&#xD;
      patients with cancer, with potential consequences such as use of oral treatments at home,&#xD;
      discontinuation of anticancer therapy depending on the context, or prioritization of&#xD;
      management according to curative/palliative treatment type, age, and line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International studies previously reported the psychological repercussions of major epidemics&#xD;
      on the emotional state. The impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer therefore warrants&#xD;
      evaluation, among cancer patients in the French West Indies, in the current situation of&#xD;
      nationwide lockdown.&#xD;
