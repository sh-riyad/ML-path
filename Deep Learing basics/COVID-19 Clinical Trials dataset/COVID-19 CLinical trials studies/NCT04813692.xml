  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemics has put an overwhelming pressure on the healthcare systems of&#xD;
      many European countries. Such a situation has potentially led to delayed and impaired access&#xD;
      to appropriate treatment for patients affected by other severe, non-COVID-19-related&#xD;
      conditions, including cardiovascular diseases. This resulted in a reported lower admission,&#xD;
      but higher mortality rate for AMI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a situation might be explained by many factors, including unavailability of early&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy and late hospital presentation of AMI patients due to a general anxiety&#xD;
      related to the COVID-19 contagious risk of the hospital environment. As a matter of fact,&#xD;
      during this year of pandemics, several case reports suggested a new, significant surge of&#xD;
      post-AMI mechanical complications, sometimes describing patients admitted in too severe&#xD;
      conditions to consider surgical repair a viable option, and therefore inevitably undergone an&#xD;
      unfavorable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we decided to involve the large network of European centers already participating&#xD;
      to the &quot;Caution Study 1&quot;, in order to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on the outcomes,&#xD;
      incidence and treatments of post-AMI mechanical complications.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical complications must be carefully searched for in any patient with an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome and signs of cardiogenic shock, as prompt diagnosis and immediate surgery often&#xD;
      represent the only effective treatment for such ominous conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of patients with postinfarction mechanical complications requires the&#xD;
      consideration of several factors: (i) the extremely poor prognosis without surgical&#xD;
      treatment; (ii) the higher mortality risk associated with emergency surgery; (iii) the&#xD;
      potential rapid deterioration of initially stable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database demonstrated an average 43%&#xD;
      in-hospital/30-day mortality for surgical treatment of ventricular septal rupture. Data from&#xD;
      the same registry on papillary muscle rupture showed a 30-day mortality of 20%. Matteucci et&#xD;
      al. recently reported a 36.4% mortality rate for free wall rupture from the large CAUTION&#xD;
      multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the low incidence of these post-AMI mechanical complications, evidence-based&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies remain controversial, and little is known on the early clinical&#xD;
      results and late follow-up, with most information derived from small single-center&#xD;
      experiences or national registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we started the &quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction: an&#xD;
      international multicenter cohort study&quot; - (Caution Study 1), a retrospective, international&#xD;
      multicenter clinical trial aimed at evaluating the survival, postoperative outcome and&#xD;
      quality of life of patients undergone cardiac surgery for post-infarction mechanical&#xD;
      complications starting from 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing COVID-19 pandemics, however, has put an overwhelming pressure on the healthcare&#xD;
      systems of many European countries. Such a situation has potentially led to delayed and&#xD;
      impaired access to appropriate treatment for patients affected by other severe,&#xD;
      non-COVID-19-related conditions, including cardiovascular diseases. This resulted in a&#xD;
      reported lower admission, but higher mortality rate for AMI patients.This situation might be&#xD;
      explained by many factors, including unavailability of early reperfusion therapy and late&#xD;
      hospital presentation of AMI patients due to a general anxiety related to the COVID-19&#xD;
      contagious risk of the hospital environment. As a matter of fact, during this year of&#xD;
      pandemics, several case reports suggested a new, significant surge of post-AMI mechanical&#xD;
      complications, sometimes describing patients admitted in too severe conditions to consider&#xD;
      surgical repair a viable option, and therefore inevitably undergone an unfavorable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we decided to involve the large network of European centers already participating&#xD;
      to the &quot;Caution Study 1&quot;, in order to study the impact of COVID-19 pandemics on the outcomes,&#xD;
      incidence and treatments of post-AMI mechanical complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction: an international multicenter cohort&#xD;
      study during COVID-19 pandemics&quot; is a retrospective, international multicenter clinical trial&#xD;
      aimed at evaluating the trend of incidence, types of treatment and survival of patients&#xD;
      admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of post-infarction mechanical complications.&#xD;
