      Subjects will be recruited and divided into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group (384 subjects): 1st dose : combined vaccination of COVIV+IIV4, 2nd dose:&#xD;
      combined vaccination of COVIV+PPV23; Control Group A (384 subjects): 1st dose: COVIV only,&#xD;
      2nd dose: COVIV only; Control Group B (384 subjects): 1st dose: IIV4 only, 2nd dose: PPV23&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected 3 times:&#xD;
&#xD;
      before the 1st dose of vaccinatioin; before the 2nd dose of vaccination; 28 days after the&#xD;
      2nd dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity and safety of both experimental and control groups will be analyzed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, parallel, controlled study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of simultaneously immunization of COVIV + PPV23 and COVIV + IIV4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1152 subjects are divided into 3 groups, including 1 experimental group and 2 control groups&#xD;
      (control group A and B). Each group includes 384 subjects respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group (384 subjects) will receive: 1st dose : combined vaccination of&#xD;
      COVIV+IIV4, 2nd dose: combined vaccination of COVIV+PPV23; Control Group A (384 subjects)&#xD;
      will receive: 1st dose: COVIV only, 2nd dose: COVIV only; Control Group B (384 subjects) will&#xD;
      receive: 1st dose: IIV4 only, 2nd dose: PPV23 only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, each group will be divided again. Each 408-subject group is divided again into&#xD;
      2 age-based subgroups: (1) 18-59 years old; (2) ≥60 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subgroup includes 192 subjects respectively. Blood samples will be collected 3 times:&#xD;
      (1) before the 1st dose of vaccinatioin; (2) before the 2nd dose of vaccination; (3) 28 days&#xD;
      after the 2nd dose of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the immunogenicity, the investigators will detect and compare the neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody levels, the seroconversion rates and antibody geometric mean concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of all groups will be monitored as well.&#xD;
