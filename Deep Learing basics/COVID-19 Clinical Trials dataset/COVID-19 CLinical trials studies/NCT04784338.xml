  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Culinary medicine has emerged which provides the practical application of nutrition education&#xD;
      through experiential learning. Studies have shown that patients with metabolic syndrome who&#xD;
      underwent a series of classes that featured nutrition recommendations and cooking classes had&#xD;
      weight loss, and improved cardiac health and blood sugar management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the increasing focus on providing remote experiences to minimize contact and risk of&#xD;
      infection with Sars-COV2, this pilot study at Boston Medical Center (BMC) will integrate a&#xD;
      physician consultation, interactive didactic presentations, nutritious cooking and mind- body&#xD;
      exercises. Patients with obesity and metabolic syndrome can attend a virtual shared medical&#xD;
      visit series co-taught by a registered dietician and chef and an endocrinologist and weight&#xD;
      management specialist. Data will be collected in the form of surveys, phone interviews, chart&#xD;
      review, and home monitoring to test both the feasibility of running such an intervention&#xD;
      virtually and to explore whether attending this one month program with weekly remote&#xD;
      classes/visits improves vitals including weight and blood blood pressure and other small&#xD;
      habit changes in patients.&#xD;
