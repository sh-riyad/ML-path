    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2 study in adult healthy subjects that have previously been vaccinated with&#xD;
      an FDA-authorized vaccine against COVID-19. This clinical trial is designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety, efficacy, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of hAd5-S-Fusion+N-ETSD formulated for&#xD;
      subcutaneous and oral (capsule) administration.&#xD;
