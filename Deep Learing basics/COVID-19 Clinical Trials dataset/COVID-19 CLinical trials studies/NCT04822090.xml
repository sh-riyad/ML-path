    <textblock>
      Although many studies investigated the prevalence and manifestations of HPV-B19 infection in&#xD;
      patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), thalassemia, and hereditary spherocytosis (HS)&#xD;
      separately, there is limited information about the extent to which HPV-B19 infection leads to&#xD;
      severe complications and chronic infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HPV-B19 is the smallest single-stranded, linear DNA virus that causes human diseases.&#xD;
      Exposure to respiratory secretions is the most common means of transmission of this virus.&#xD;
      Infection is associated with a variety of manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe&#xD;
      complications that depending on the host's hematological and immunological status. No&#xD;
      prospective comparative studies investigated the risks associated with this pathogenic virus&#xD;
      and predicted the disease course and morbidity among hereditary hemolytic anemia (HHA)&#xD;
      patients classified by their underlying diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nobody has studied the underlying causes of the different and unusual presentations in acute&#xD;
      symptomatic HPV-B19 infection in hereditary hemolytic anemias patients. So that, this first&#xD;
      head-to-head study to compare thalassemia, sickle cell anemia (SCA), and spherocytosis (HS)&#xD;
      patients presented with acute symptomatic HPV-B19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studying the relationship between viremia, humoral immune response, and the underlying&#xD;
      disease in patients presenting with acute symptomatic HPV-B19 infection should be useful for&#xD;
      clarifying the undiagnosed pathophysiological mechanisms and other accessory factors to&#xD;
      improve the diagnosis and management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, early diagnosis of risk factors of unusual presentations of acute symptomatic&#xD;
      HPV-B19 infection will be a useful tool for better treatment strategy, follow up and&#xD;
      prognosis as well as prevent future complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted from haematology clinics and emergency departments of Sohag and Assiut&#xD;
      University Hospitals for HHA-related complications or manifestations suggesting HHA were&#xD;
      screened continuously between February 2018 to February 2020 for enrolment in this study and&#xD;
      monthly followed for at least one-year and 3 years post HPV-B19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      First 2 years, the candidate patients who will have evidence of HHA and/or will present with&#xD;
      manifestations suggesting HHA and agree to comply with follow-up instructions will be&#xD;
      screened for enrollment in this study and additional will be followed for at least one-year&#xD;
      post-HPV-B19 infection. Patient data will be included demographics, relevant comorbidities,&#xD;
      need for hospital admission, need for blood or plasma transfusion, renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      or plasma exchange, hospital length of stay, completion of hospitalization (hospital&#xD;
      discharge and death), cardiac events, neurological and respiratory events, type of treatments&#xD;
      administered, and inflammatory laboratory parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of HHA in the study patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory investigations&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine Biochemical Investigations Liver and renal function tests (LFTs), bilirubin,&#xD;
           blood sugar, lipid, and indicated hormonal profiles will be performed on Cobas c 311&amp;&#xD;
           modular P auto analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), lactate dehydrogenase&#xD;
           (LDH)&#xD;
&#xD;
           : analysis will be done with Dimension Rx Max-Siemens &amp; urine analysis, and albumin&#xD;
           creatinine ratio will be performed for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hematological analysis Complete blood count: peripheral blood samples will be withdrawn&#xD;
           for diagnostic laboratory investigations and routine follow-up. 2- ml blood will be&#xD;
           collected on potassium- ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant coated&#xD;
           tube for CBC using Cell-Dyn 3700, automated cell counter (Abbott diagnostic, Dallas,&#xD;
           USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hereditary Hemolytic Anemia Diagnosis HHA will be suspected by clinical/family history&#xD;
           of patient, examination, and laboratory tests including full complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
           calculation of red blood cells (RBCs) indices, corrected reticulocyte count, peripheral&#xD;
           blood smear (PBS), iron study, total and direct bilirubin (TB, DB), increased serum LDH,&#xD;
           decreased serum haptoglobin, and negative direct antiglobulin (Coomb's) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Confirmation of HHA and identification of subtypes will be done by a series of&#xD;
           specialized investigations as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol of Hb electrophoresis, sickle solubility testing, and studying Hb fractions&#xD;
           with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) will be used for the diagnosis of&#xD;
           hemoglobinopathies, such as SCA and thalassemia as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Diagnosis of RBC Membranopathy and Enzymopathy Hereditary red cell membrane&#xD;
           disorders, such as HS and elliptocytosis will be identified by blood smear examination,&#xD;
           red cell osmotic fragility test (OFT) with and without 24 hours incubation, acidified&#xD;
           glycerol lysis test (AGLT), and RBC labeling with eosin-5'-maleimide (EMA) dye and&#xD;
           subsequent measurement of RBC mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) by flowcytometry as&#xD;
           previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients considered having HS will base on clinical and laboratory signs of chronic&#xD;
           hemolysis, presence of spherocytes at PBS, plus two positive tests (OFT, AGLT, and EMA&#xD;
           binding test) or at least one test with a family history of HS, and exclusion of other&#xD;
           causes of secondary spherocytosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be evaluated for RBC enzymes' activity, such as glucose-6-phosphate&#xD;
           dehydrogenase (G6PD) to detect the coexistence of RBC enzymopathies and membranopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Detection of HPV-B19 and HHA-Patients' Comparator Groups During the study period, any&#xD;
           HHA-patient will have manifestations suggesting HPV-B19 infection (fever/ muscle pains&#xD;
           /rash/ arthropathy/ lymphadenopathy/ rapid drop in Hb level and reticulocytopenia)&#xD;
           and/or contact with a suspected case of erythema infectiosum will be investigated for&#xD;
           anti-parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG immunoglobulin status. Those HPV-B19 seronegative will&#xD;
           be retested 2 to 3 weeks later. HPV-B19 immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) status will be&#xD;
           determined by chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIA) technology from (Diasorin, Saluggia,&#xD;
           Italy). Additionally, serological tests for hepatitis, HIV, CMV, and EBV viruses will be&#xD;
           done to exclude other recent viral infections. Blood cultures and sensitivity will be&#xD;
           performed to exclude septicemia. The presence of signs, symptoms, HPV-B19 specific IgM,&#xD;
           and absence of IgM of other viruses will be considered as proof of recent symptomatic&#xD;
           HPV-B19 infection. Patients will be divided based on previous criteria into two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I= HHA patients with acute symptomatic HPV-B19 infection, Group II= HHA patients&#xD;
      without acute symptomatic HPV-B19 infection. Then group I patients will be subdivided&#xD;
      according to underlying disease into three subgroups: Group Ia: HPV-B19(+)Î²-thalassemia,&#xD;
      Group Ib: HPV-B19(+)HS, and Group Ic: HPV-B19(+)SCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different presenting features of HPV-B19 infection, such as a number of cytopenias, acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI), hepatitis, and level of hyperbilirubinemia in group I will be compared.&#xD;
      AKI will be diagnosed and classified according to the last guidelines. Extreme&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia will be considered when total bilirubin &gt;25 mg/dL. The clinical&#xD;
      presentation at baseline was recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.4. Other Investigations The diagnosis of HPV-B19 extra-hematological manifestations,&#xD;
      associated autoimmune disorders, cellular and humoral immune deficiencies will be determined&#xD;
      using several methods such as detection of several autoantibodies, flowcytometry, serum&#xD;
      immunoglobulins level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological studies of BM, spleen, and liver biopsies will be done after patients'&#xD;
      acceptance in restricted conditions and according to guidelines for an indication of biopsy&#xD;
      as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BM aspiration and biopsy will be done for patients with persistent severe BMF non&#xD;
           responded to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Splenic biopsy from patients who will be submitted for elective splenectomy according to&#xD;
           recommendations regarding splenectomy in HHA(13).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver biopsy will be done for patients with persistently abnormal liver function with&#xD;
           serological test positive to autoimmune or sclerosing cholangitis to differentiate the&#xD;
           underlying disease for proper management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiologic assessment by echocardiography, X-ray chest and long bones, and abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound will be routinely performed for screening all patients. The HHA patients with&#xD;
      extreme hyperbilirubinemia or obstructive jaundice will be screened by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group I patients will be monthly followed for at least one-year post HPV-B19 infection. Group&#xD;
      II patients will be diligently followed for the time of writing this manuscript. During this&#xD;
      period, complications, and laboratory profiles including BM aspiration if the patient had&#xD;
      severe cytopenia, will be checked. All patients will be scanned by echocardiography and&#xD;
      examined by ultrasound to view the gallbladder, kidneys, spleen, and liver size (cm). The&#xD;
      events of interest will be recorded, such as bone marrow failure (BMF), spleen sequestration,&#xD;
      chest pain, vaso-occlusive crisis, cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and choledocholithiasis and&#xD;
      transfusion frequency&#xD;
