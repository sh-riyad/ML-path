    <textblock>
      Background: Lymphopenia is reported to be associated with the severity of disease progression&#xD;
      in COVID-19. Low lymphocyte count is also associated with increasing age. No study has yet&#xD;
      investigated the effects of lymphopenia in this disease on the outcome in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To assess the outcome of lymphopenia in elderly patients having COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      usefulness as prognostic factor in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Retrospective cohort study. Clinical data (medical history, comorbidities,&#xD;
      treatments, geriatric syndromes) and biological parameters will be collected from 100&#xD;
      hospitalized geriatric COVID-19 patients (&gt; 70 yrs.) (Group 1) and 100 hospitalized geriatric&#xD;
      patients (&gt; 70 yrs.) presenting with acute infection other than COVID-19 (Group 2) and will&#xD;
      be compared according to the presence/absence of lymphopenia. A third Group (3) will be&#xD;
      studied to assess the influence of comorbidities on lymphopenia consisting of healthy aged&#xD;
      elderly (&gt; 70 yrs.).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction In December 2019 a cluster of viral pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in the&#xD;
      Hubei Province of China, led to the discovery of a novel pathogen that was later named Severe&#xD;
      Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread&#xD;
      throughout the population of China and subsequently to all continents of the world (except&#xD;
      for Antarctica). On 11 March 2020 the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health&#xD;
      Organisation (WHO) (2). In September confirmed cases have been reported from 217 different&#xD;
      countries and has resulted in over 27 million infected individuals and as near as 900.000&#xD;
      deadly cases reported to the WHO (3, 4). SARS-CoV-2 does not discriminate between social&#xD;
      status, age or ethnicity and an effective treatment remains absent until so far. However,&#xD;
      risk factors associated with severity of disease progression have been identified and include&#xD;
      advanced age (&gt;65y), comorbidities with inclusion of arterial hypertension, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease and laboratory parameters such as low&#xD;
      CD3+CD8+ T cells (&lt;75 cells.µL-1), low lymphocyte count, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N/L)&#xD;
      (N/L ratio &gt;3.13) and increased cardiac troponin I (≥0.05ng.mL-1) (5-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that both age and lymphopenia are risk factors associated with&#xD;
      severity of disease progression in COVID-19 patients. A low lymphocyte count, however, is&#xD;
      also known to be associated with increasing age in healthy individuals (10). Another study&#xD;
      has also shown that a high CRP was associated with lymphopenia in a geriatric hospitalized&#xD;
      population before the apparition of COVID-19 (11). This observation raises the question&#xD;
      whether or not lymphopenia is a specific prognostic marker for the COVID-19 illness in&#xD;
      elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the specificity of lymphopenia in COVID-19 cases in elderly people thanks to&#xD;
           the comparison of 3 Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Group 1 consists of COVID-19 cases&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Group 2 consists of patients with an acute infection other than COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Group 3 consists of healthy aged people defined as in the modified SENIEUR protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the correlation of lymphopenia in COVID-19 cases and the outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess the relationship between other morbidities (such as CV diseases / risk&#xD;
           factors) and lymphopenia in elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the outcome of lymphopenia in COVID-19 infections in elderly patients, three Groups&#xD;
      will be studied:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will consist of 100 patients COVID-19 positive patients older than 70 years old&#xD;
      hospitalized in UZ Brussel from February 2020 until September 2020 with a positive RT-PCR&#xD;
      test for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will consist of 100 patients older than 70 years old hospitalized in UZ Brussel for&#xD;
      acute infections other than COVID-19. To avoid including false negative patients, these&#xD;
      patients will be selected from January 2019 until December 2019, before the first COVID-19&#xD;
      cases were documented in Belgium. An acute infection other than COVID-19 will be defined as&#xD;
      1) viral infection confirmed by nasopharynx swab for: influenza, RSV, parainfluenza,&#xD;
      rhinoviruses, coronaviruses or 2) bacterial infection confirmed with positive blood culture,&#xD;
      positive articular punction, positive expectorations, pneumonia on chest radiograph, or&#xD;
      infection documented by abdominal imagery (CT or echo), a positive urine culture with a&#xD;
      confirmed pyelonephritis with a renal echography or a DMSA scintigraphy or specific clinical&#xD;
      symptoms for pyelonephritis and positive hemoculture. A positive urine culture alone is not&#xD;
      considered as urine infection because of the high prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria in&#xD;
      geriatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the influence of comorbidities on lymphopenia in elderly people, the Groups 1 and 2&#xD;
      will be compared to a well-defined historical group (Group 3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will consist of healthy aged people defined as in the modified SENIEUR protocol (12,&#xD;
      13). This group is recruited from a previously conducted study. These are community dwelling&#xD;
      individuals above the age of 70 and considered as almost healthy with some conditions that&#xD;
      are present in the majority of old people such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis or&#xD;
      atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Cfr definition of the three groups Exclusion criteria Patients receiving&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy, patients with known active cancer or hematologic disorders,&#xD;
      patients undergoing radio- or chemotherapy or with known autoimmune diseases will not be&#xD;
      included since these underlying conditions or therapies can interfere with white blood cell&#xD;
      count in a way that is beyond the scope of this research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of clinical characteristics All subjects will be assessed for underlying&#xD;
      illnesses by medical archives and blood sampling. Social evaluation included determination of&#xD;
      age, gender and home (private versus institution). Clinical data included smoking and alcohol&#xD;
      habits, body mass index (BMI), medical history, current treatment and reasons for&#xD;
      hospitalization. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are defined as a history of stroke, myocardial&#xD;
      infarct, cardiac insufficiency (assessed by anterior cardiac echography and clinical&#xD;
      symptoms), cerebral vascular disease or atheromatosis assessed by carotid or leg Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography and ischemic symptoms. CV risk factors will be defined by the presence in the&#xD;
      medical history of arterial hypertension (AHT), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM 2),&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia or statin intake, infarct history or smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive geriatric assessment When possible, we will obtain a comprehensive geriatric&#xD;
      assessment: The comorbidities and the severity of the medical problems were scored using the&#xD;
      &quot;Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric&quot; (CIRS-G), which is an instrument to quantify&#xD;
      disease burden. It differentiates older adults with the highest risk and severity of&#xD;
      infection with a markedly impaired vaccine response (14). It comprises a comprehensive review&#xD;
      of medical problems of 14 organ systems. It is based on a 0 to 4 rating of each organ system&#xD;
      (15). The &quot;Geriatric Depression Scale&quot; was used to assess the risk of depression (GDS-15) in&#xD;
      15 questions (16). The assessment of &quot;Activities of Daily Living&quot; (ADL) was made using Katz's&#xD;
      scale. It includes the following items: bathing, dressing, transfer, toilet, continence and&#xD;
      eating. Each task is graded on a 4-level scale (1 to 4 for Katz's scale), where lower levels&#xD;
      represent the absence of dependence and upper levels the maximal dependence for the task&#xD;
      (17). Cognitive functions were assessed using the &quot;Mini Mental State Examination&quot; (MMSE).&#xD;
      Possible scores range from 0 to 30 points, with scores&lt;24/30 indicating impaired cognitive&#xD;
      function (18). Nutritional status was assessed using the &quot;Malnutrition Universal Screening&#xD;
      Tool&quot; (MUST) (19). Social complexity was defined by the need for an intervention with a&#xD;
      social worker (need for home care, rehabilitation nursing home or financial help). The sum of&#xD;
      geriatric syndrome includes the following: fall, social complexity, delirium, undernutrition,&#xD;
      dependence, depression, dysphagia, incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, inappropriate&#xD;
      prescription, and cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological parameters Data from the routine biochemical assessment performed in the first 24&#xD;
      hrs and after 3 to 5 days after admission to a geriatric unit will be collected (total and&#xD;
      differential white blood cell counts, hemoglobin and hematocrit, renal function and&#xD;
      electrolytes CRP, albumin, prealbumin, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the outcome of patients with or without lymphopenia, the number of&#xD;
      rehospitalisation's, the admissions to an intensive care unit, the complications such as lung&#xD;
      embolism, the duration of the hospital stay, the mortality, the place of the discharge and&#xD;
      the severity score of the CT scan of the thorax in COVID-19 + patients will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures This is a retrospective study. No interventions will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowchart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study analysis Statistical analysis IBM SPSS version 25 will be used for statistical&#xD;
      analyses. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test will be used to determine the normality of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mann Whitney rank sum test for non-parametric data or a student T-test for parametric data&#xD;
      will be performed to compare patients with and without lymphopenia for COVID-19, other&#xD;
      infections, comorbidities, complications, geriatric assessment, duration of hospitalisation,&#xD;
      rehospitalisation, mortality, place of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to identify clinical and biological factors that could be significantly associated&#xD;
      with lymphopenia, we performed univariate analyses (depicted by Pearson's coefficient). For&#xD;
      all volunteers, these parameters comprised CV diseases and risk factors (smoking, arterial&#xD;
      hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cholesterol levels, BMI), COVID-19, other infections,&#xD;
      comorbidities, complications, geriatric assessment, duration of hospitalisation,&#xD;
      rehospitalisation, mortality, place of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to define independent predictive factors of lymphopenia, we tested several models by&#xD;
      stepwise backward multi-linear regression analyses.&#xD;
