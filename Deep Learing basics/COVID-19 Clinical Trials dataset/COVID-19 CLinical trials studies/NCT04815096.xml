    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single arm exploratory imaging study involving up to two intravenous&#xD;
      microdoses of [18F]F-AraG (the second tracer dose is optional) followed by whole-body PET-CT&#xD;
      imaging in participants with convalescent COVID-19. Up to 20 participants will be enrolled&#xD;
      over an accrual period of approximately 24 months. Each participant will undergo one PET-CT&#xD;
      scan following 50 +/- 10 minutes uptake following a single bolus injection of [18F]F-AraG in&#xD;
      order to determine the tissue distribution of tracer in pariticpants with recent SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. A second optional [18F]F-AraG dose and PET-CT will be offered approximately 4&#xD;
      months following the initial imaging time point.&#xD;

      This is a single center exploratory imaging study involving up to two intravenous microdoses&#xD;
      of [18F]F-AraG (the second tracer dose is optional) followed by whole-body PET-CT imaging in&#xD;
      participants 18 years of age and older with recent SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and COVID-19 at least&#xD;
      14 days following onset of symptoms. The primary objective is to determine the anatomical&#xD;
      distribution of [18F]F-AraG in participant with convalescent COVID-19 approximately 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 5 months (optional, 4 months following first PET imaging visit) following onset of&#xD;
      symptoms (N = 20). Tracer activity will also be compared with sex and age-matched uninfected&#xD;
      historical control participants enrolled in prior studies. Up to 20 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study who will be identified in the UCSF LIINC longitudinal COVID-19 cohort&#xD;
      study. Each participant will undergo one PET-CT scan following 50 +/- 10 minutes uptake&#xD;
      following a single bolus injection of [18F]F-AraG. A second optional [18F]F-AraG dose and&#xD;
      PET-CT will be offered approximately 4 months following the initial imaging time point.&#xD;
