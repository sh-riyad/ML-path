      Background: To investigate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with vascular disorders after implementing institutional and governmental safety measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Vascular patients (VPs) admitted to our tertiary care hospital were&#xD;
      routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection on a two days basis between March and December,&#xD;
      2020. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was compared between VPs and two independent Austrian&#xD;
      populations (April and November 2020) tested by the Austrian Ministry of Science. The results&#xD;
      were also compared to a cohort of health care personnel (HCP) working in close proximity to&#xD;
      the study patients, tested weekly, between March and December, 2020. RT-PCR and antigen test&#xD;
      were used to detect SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;

    <description>Nasal or pharyngeal respiratory swabs were routinely taken of each patient admitted at our departments and repeated regularly at 48 h intervals during the inpatient stay.&#xD;
In the HCP cohort testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed, on a weekly basis, at the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Austria, using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Comparability of the results of all test methods used was confirmed by participation in international quality control ring trials.</description>
