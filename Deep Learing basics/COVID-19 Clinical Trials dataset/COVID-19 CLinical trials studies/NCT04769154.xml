  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this descriptive observational study is to evaluate endotracheal intubation during&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic at the AUBMC outside the OR (excluding the Emergency Department (ED)) and&#xD;
      compare the success and complication rates with previous literature and international&#xD;
      benchmarks. The investigators will assess the rate of successful endotracheal intubations at&#xD;
      first attempt, the total number of attempts at endotracheal intubation, the devices used for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation (direct laryngoscopy, video laryngoscopy, endotracheal boogie, Fiber&#xD;
      optic etc.â€¦), the anesthetic drugs given before intubation, the Cormack-Lehane score&#xD;
      (compared with previous score if present for the same patient), the MACOCHA score in addition&#xD;
      to the complication rates including but not limited to events of hypotension (SBP &lt; 80 mmHg),&#xD;
      severe hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt; 85%), respiratory or cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that endotracheal intubation outside the OR at AUBMC has higher&#xD;
      success rates and lower complication rates as compared to the literature. The investigators&#xD;
      believe this is due to the fact that the devices and teams available for intubation outside&#xD;
      the OR are highly efficient and very versatile compared to other facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to assess the success rate of endotracheal intubation at&#xD;
      first attempt outside the operating room with direct laryngoscopy or with the use of an&#xD;
      assisting device. The secondary outcomes will identify adverse events; mainly hypoxemia (SpO2&#xD;
      &lt; 85%) and hypotension (SBP &lt; 80 mmHg).&#xD;
