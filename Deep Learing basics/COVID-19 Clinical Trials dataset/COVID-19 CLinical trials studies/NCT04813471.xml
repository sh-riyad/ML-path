    <textblock>
      COVID-19 Infection has been found to cause endothelial dysfunction and most of the adverse&#xD;
      events stem to this mechanism. So we seek to target endothelial dysfunction in critically Ill&#xD;
      patients with covid by giving them an endothelial protocol ( L-arginine, Folic Acid, Statin,&#xD;
      Nicorandil, Vitamin B complex) and monitor clinical outcome in those patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel pathogen&#xD;
      responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first discovered in Wuhan, China [1].&#xD;
      Since its emergence in late December 2019, many pathophysiological mechanisms have been&#xD;
      proposed with multiple pathways that involve various organ systems [2, 3]. Although&#xD;
      considered at its emergence as a respiratory infection with manifestations ranging from lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection to pneumonia and advancing to acute respiratory disease syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) in its final stages, recent evidence has highlighted how disseminated the virus can be&#xD;
      affecting almost every organ be it the heart, kidneys, or blood vessels . Recent trends in&#xD;
      research have focused on elucidating the cardiovascular dysfunction in COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      especially following studies showing that cardiovascular risk factors are among the most&#xD;
      common presenting comorbidities and that cardiovascular complications of SARS-CoV-2 are among&#xD;
      the most lethal [4-11] . Initial research revealed that the virus makes use of the&#xD;
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, a widely expressed receptor found in&#xD;
      multiple cells lining the lung, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys and endothelial cells&#xD;
      to infiltrate host cells. Another prominent mechanism of infection is immune system&#xD;
      dysregulation manifesting as a cytokine storm and inflammatory response over-activation [12,&#xD;
      13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts at laying out a comprehensive or unifying pathogenesis of a COVID-19 infection have&#xD;
      singled out endothelial dysfunction as a core pathway [14]. The endothelium is a monolayer of&#xD;
      squamous endothelial cells lining the inner surface of arteries, veins and microvasculature.&#xD;
      The endothelium hence plays a major role in homeostasis with interactive roles in blood&#xD;
      pressure regulation, anti-coagulation and immune protection. Moreover, it is relevant to note&#xD;
      that the most common comorbidities that present with COVID-19 such as hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
      obesity and old age are all underlined by pre-existing endothelial damage or dysfunction. As&#xD;
      such, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress and their relation to the manifestation&#xD;
      and progression of COVID-19 infections has gained significant traction in recent publications&#xD;
      [15]. This breakthrough exposes several causes of endothelial dysfunction which include&#xD;
      direct lining attack, hypoxia, cytokine storm and suppressed endothelial nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase (eNOS) with concomitant nitric oxide deficiency [15]. Several studies have&#xD;
      emphasized the role of Nitric Oxide (NO) signaling as a major regulator of vascular tone with&#xD;
      its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic activity. For example, augmenting the&#xD;
      production of NO and its bioavailability by Nicorandil has been proposed as a potential&#xD;
      treatment in patients with COVID 19. Nicorandil is a vasodilatory agent composed of&#xD;
      N-[2-hydroxyethyl]-Nicotinamide Nitrate) used among patients with acute heart failure&#xD;
      emergencies. However, it has never been tested in patients with cardiovascular complications&#xD;
      resulting from COVID 19 [16]. Moreover, statins are cardio-protective in nature with recent&#xD;
      reports showing that they can be beneficial in COVID-19 [17]. An important mechanism via&#xD;
      which Statins may improve endothelial function include increasing the production of NO and&#xD;
      subsequent vasodilation effect, along with its established major anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant properties [17]. Vitamin B complex will be used because of the role it plays in&#xD;
      cell functioning, energy metabolism, and proper immune function. In addition of its&#xD;
      assistance in proper activation of the immune response, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      levels, improving respiratory function, maintaining endothelial integrity, preventing&#xD;
      hypercoagulability and reducing the length of stay in hospital. [18-19-20] Furthermore, eNOS&#xD;
      overexpression leads to an increase in NO formation only when the BH4 synthase&#xD;
      GTP-cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH-1) is also up-regulated. So, Folic Acid and L-arginine will be&#xD;
      given to supplement our patients with BH4 (Tetrahydrobiopterin) [21]. We hypothesize that its&#xD;
      administration along with the other previously mentioned agents would improve endothelial&#xD;
      function in patients suffering from COVID 19 via a cumulative increase in the bioavailability&#xD;
      of NO, and thus improving patients' outcomes&#xD;
