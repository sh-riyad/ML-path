      The primary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the safety profile of all participants in each age group and each study&#xD;
           intervention group up to 12 months post-last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody profile at Day 1, Day 22, and Day 36 of each study&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe binding antibody profile from Day 1 to Day 387 of each study intervention&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the neutralizing antibody profile from Day 90 to Day 387 of each study&#xD;
           intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the occurrence of virologically-confirmed COVID-19-like illness and&#xD;
           serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the correlation/association between antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA&#xD;
           vaccine and the risk of virologically-confirmed COVID-19-like illness and/or&#xD;
           serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a sequential group prevention study consisting of a sentinel cohort followed by the Full Enrollment Cohort. There will be 3 arms (5 participants 18-49 years of age for each arm) in the Sentinel Cohort, which will be done in an open-label, dose escalation fashion with stepwise safety evaluation for each dose level and each vaccination. All sentinel participants will receive 2 vaccinations, 21 days apart. For the Full Enrollment Cohort, participants will be stratified into 2 age groups based on age at enrollment: the younger adult age group (200 participants 18-49 years of age) and the older adult age group (200 participants ≥ 50 years of age). The Full Enrollment Cohort 1 (Groups 1 to 4) will receive a single injection of study intervention while participants in Cohort 2 (Groups 5 to 8) will receive 2 vaccinations (to be given 21 days apart).</intervention_model_description>

Only study site staff who prepare and administer the vaccine and are not involved with the safety evaluations will be unblinded to vaccine group assignment. There will be no blinding for injection schedule.&#xD;
