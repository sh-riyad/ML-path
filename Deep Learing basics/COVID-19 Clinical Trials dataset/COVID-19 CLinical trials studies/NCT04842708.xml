      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effect of vaccination on breath VOC&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By capturing and analyzing the breath of anti-COVID-19 vaccinated subjects during the period&#xD;
      of antibody production, the investigators will determine and quantify all the compounds&#xD;
      associated with the body reaction to the COVID-19 antigen.&#xD;

      The objective of this study will be to evaluate the effect of vaccination on breath VOC&#xD;
      content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By capturing and analyzing the breath of anti-COVID-19 vaccinated subjects during the period&#xD;
      of antibody production, the investigators will determine and quantify all the compounds&#xD;
      associated with the body reaction to the COVID-19 antigen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapidly growing serological evidence shows that IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against the S or&#xD;
      N proteins evolve rapidly in the serum of asymptomatic as well as symptomatic COVID-19&#xD;
      patients within a week of infection or symptom onset and stay elevated with progressing&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the standard serology testing at Shamir Medical center tracks the presence of IgG only,&#xD;
      those serologic tests will be conducted before and 48 hours following the second vaccination&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, since IgM antibodies are known to be produced by four to seven days following&#xD;
      the first dose of vaccination, although IgM serology testing cannot be performed, the&#xD;
      investigators are interested in sampling breath at this time range, in order for them to&#xD;
      correlate it with the changes in the subjects' physiologic condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is an unknown metabolic volatile compound mixture, the goal will be to identify&#xD;
      compounds and quantify them with a high level of precision and subsequently correlate them&#xD;
      with the disease.&#xD;
