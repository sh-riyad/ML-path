  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: School closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic represent a risk factor for the&#xD;
      development of childhood obesity due to the increase in unhealthy behaviors. Online lifestyle&#xD;
      interventions in schoolchildren could help to mitigate this problem. However, to date, no&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have been performed to prevent obesity in schoolchildren during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a 4-month online&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention on the BMI Z-score of Mexican schoolchildren during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic in an intervention group compared to a control group. Methodology: This is a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. Schoolchildren from a public elementary school in Hermosillo,&#xD;
      Sonora, Mexico will be invited to participate. Participants will be randomized to an&#xD;
      intervention group (online lifestyle intervention) or a control group. The intervention will&#xD;
      include online sessions of nutrition education and physical activity and nutrition&#xD;
      information for parents. The control group will receive a digital brochure with nutrition&#xD;
      recommendations at the beginning of the study. The measurements will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      and 4 months. The primary outcome will be the BMI Z- score. Secondary outcomes: waist&#xD;
      circumference, fat percentage, nutritional knowledge, lifestyle parameters, retention,&#xD;
      attendance at the program sessions, and acceptability of the intervention. The difference&#xD;
      between groups in changes in the outcomes will be analyzed using an intention to treat&#xD;
      analysis. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of&#xD;
      Sonora Nursing Department (EPM-003-2020). Conclusion: The study will provide the first&#xD;
      evidence of the evaluation of online interventions for the prevention of obesity in&#xD;
      schoolchildren derived from a Randomized Controlled Trial. This information will be important&#xD;
      for the development and implementation of other school-level obesity prevention programs&#xD;
      around the world.&#xD;
