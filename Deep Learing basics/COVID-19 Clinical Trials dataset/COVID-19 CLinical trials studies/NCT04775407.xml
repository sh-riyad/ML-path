  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has lately caused worldwide health problems. Patients&#xD;
      suffering from a severe mental disorder are at increased risk for infectious diseases. The&#xD;
      primary aim of the present surveillance study is to perform COVID-19 serological testing on&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or a bipolar affective&#xD;
      disorder. Patients from the catchment area of the Capital Region of Denmark will be COVID-19&#xD;
      tested at baseline (0 months) and again at 6 and 12 months, in order to follow the spread of&#xD;
      COVID-19 among this vulnerable patient population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from severe mental illness could be in increased risk for a severe outcome&#xD;
      if infected with COVID-19. Also, there are reports on fewer treatment activities among&#xD;
      psychiatric patients (e.g. higher heart disease mortality), lower hospitalization rate and&#xD;
      fewer invasive cardiac procedures among persons with schizophrenia than among the general&#xD;
      population. This conveys a risk not only for the patient but for the spread of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      the community. At present, we expect the outcome of a COVID-19 infection to be worse among&#xD;
      the mentioned psychiatric patient population, but whether the spread of COVID-19 differs from&#xD;
      the pattern observed in the general population is unknown. This information is of pivotal&#xD;
      interest to come up with sufficient treatment strategies - especially when facing a possible&#xD;
      second surge in the COVID-19 spread. Moreover, it is to the best of our knowledge unknown&#xD;
      whether a possible CNS COVID-19 infection will worsen existing psychopathology among patients&#xD;
      with severe schizophrenia, schizoaffective- or bipolar affective disorder. The study is&#xD;
      exploratory in nature including as many patients as possible for testing. The target&#xD;
      population is patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or a bipolar&#xD;
      affective disorder receiving in-patient or out-patient care via one of the psychiatric&#xD;
      centres in The Mental Health Services in the Capital Region of Denmark. Each patient will&#xD;
      attend 3 study visits during a period of 12 months. A blood sample for IgG and IgM analysis&#xD;
      for will be drawn at every visit.&#xD;
