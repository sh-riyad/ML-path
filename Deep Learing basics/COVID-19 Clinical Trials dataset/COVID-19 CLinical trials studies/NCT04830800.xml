      This prospective, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 1/2&#xD;
      study includes two separate parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a first-in-human, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the COVIVAC vaccine at three different dose levels (1, 3, and 10 µg)&#xD;
      without adjuvant, and at one dose level (1 µg) with the adjuvant CpG 1018, in a total of 120&#xD;
      subjects aged 18-59 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 of this combined Phase 1/2 study, 300 adults aged 18-75 years will be randomized&#xD;
      (2:5:5) to placebo, or one of two selected formulations of COVIVAC being evaluated in Phase 1&#xD;

      This prospective, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind Phase 1/2&#xD;
      study includes two separate parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 is a first-in-human, Phase 1 study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the COVIVAC vaccine at three different dose levels (1, 3, and 10 µg)&#xD;
      without adjuvant, and at one dose level (1 µg) with the adjuvant CpG 1018, in a total of 120&#xD;
      subjects aged 18-59 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of Phase 1 data conducted after the last subject last visit for V6 (D57)&#xD;
      will serve as the basis for decisions about down selection and advancing to Part 2 of the&#xD;
      study (Phase 2). Down selection and advancement to Part 2 (Phase 2) will be based on the&#xD;
      following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-dose 2 immunogenicity results at the aggregate treatment level&#xD;
&#xD;
           o A threshold immune response at Visit 5 (D43) will be required: the observed&#xD;
           seroresponse rate in a treatment group (defined as the percentage of subjects with at&#xD;
           least a 4-fold rise from baseline in 80% neutralizing antibody titers) will need to be&#xD;
           ≥52% at the LL of the 95% CI for that treatment (vaccine formulation) to be considered&#xD;
           for advancement to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-dose 1 and post dose 2 safety results including all solicited and unsolicited&#xD;
           adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical laboratory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following process will be followed for the decision about down selection and advancing to&#xD;
      Part 2 (Phase 2):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The DSMB will review the unblinded safety data and provide a recommendation to the&#xD;
           Sponsor on whether the safety profile is acceptable for advancing a formulation to Phase&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Sponsor will review the DSMB recommendation in conjunction with the immunogenicity&#xD;
           data and select two formulations to advance to Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           o If multiple formulations achieve the threshold immune response (as well as have an&#xD;
           adequate safety and tolerability profile per the DSMB), the Sponsor will select two&#xD;
           formulations to advance to Phase 2 based on consideration of such factors as the&#xD;
           relative functional immunogenicity of these formulations, opportunity for dose sparing,&#xD;
           and opportunity to limit cost and possible supply constraints associated with use of the&#xD;
           CpG adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The selection and recommendation to advance to Phase 2 along with the interim report&#xD;
           will be jointly reviewed by NIHE's IRB and MoH prior to Phase 2 enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2 of this combined Phase 1/2 study, 300 adults aged 18-75 years will be randomized&#xD;
      (2:5:5) to placebo, or one of two selected formulations of COVIVAC being evaluated in Phase&#xD;
      1. At least one-third of the subjects in Phase 2 will be aged ≥60 years to ensure that&#xD;
      adequate safety and immune data will be available from older and elderly adults to inform the&#xD;
      selection of the COVIVAC formulation to advance to Phase 3 studies. The Phase 2 cohort will&#xD;
      follow the same visit schedule, and undergo the same procedures and assessments, as in Phase&#xD;
      1. In addition, as exploratory objectives, the anti-NDV HN IgG response will be assessed at&#xD;
      V1, V3, V5, and V8 in all subjects, and 36 subjects (equally distributed between the two age&#xD;
      strata) will be randomly selected in a 1:1:1 ratio to provide additional blood at V1, V5 and&#xD;
      V7 to be used to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for assessment of&#xD;
      T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis of Phase 2 data (combined with immunogenicity and safety data generated&#xD;
      for the placebo group and two selected COVIVAC formulations from Phase 1) will be conducted&#xD;
      after the last subject of the Phase 2 cohort completes V6 (D57) as the basis for selecting&#xD;
      the optimal formulation of COVIVAC to advance to Phase 3 studies. As was the case for the&#xD;
      Phase 1 interim analysis at the same timepoint, the data generated will include unblinded&#xD;
      post-dose 1 and dose 2 safety results for review by the DSMB, and immunogenicity results&#xD;
      aggregated by treatment group for review by the Sponsor. The DSMB will consider all&#xD;
      accumulated safety data from both phases of the study prior to making any recommendation to&#xD;
      the Sponsor that it not advance a formulation based on safety concerns. The Sponsor will&#xD;
      ultimately select the formulation to advance to Phase 3 that, in addition to having been&#xD;
      judged by the DSMB to have an adequate safety and tolerability profile, is optimal based on&#xD;
      relative functional immunogenicity and other programmatic considerations such as those noted&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
