  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One investigational treatment being explored for COVID-19 is the use of convalescent plasma&#xD;
      collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 (Refs. 1-4). Convalescent plasma&#xD;
      that contains antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARSCoV-2 (the&#xD;
      virus that causes COVID-19) is being studied for administration to patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
      Use of convalescent plasma has been studied in outbreaks of other respiratory infections,&#xD;
      including the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, and the&#xD;
      2012 MERS-CoV epidemic (Refs. 5-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although promising, convalescent plasma has not yet been shown to be safe and effective as a&#xD;
      treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, it is important to study the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      COVID19 convalescent plasma in clinical trials. This guidance provides recommendations to&#xD;
      health care providers and investigators on the administration and study of investigational&#xD;
      convalescent plasma collected from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 (COVID-19&#xD;
      convalescent plasma) during the public health emergency. This guidance also provides&#xD;
      recommendations to blood establishments on the collection of COVID-19 convalescent plasma..&#xD;

      laboratory-confirmed patients using qRT-PCR will be enrolled in the study. Eligibility&#xD;
      criteria for recipients are ; laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, Severe or immediately&#xD;
      life-threatening. Severe disease defined as one or more of the following; shortness of&#xD;
      breath( dyspnoea), respiratory frequency≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, a partial&#xD;
      pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300, and lung infiltrates&#xD;
      &gt;50% within 24-48 hours. While a life-threatening disease is defined as one or more of the&#xD;
      following; respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, septic shock and multiple&#xD;
      organ dysfunction or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: All patients included in the study provided will be administered with two&#xD;
      plasma units (each unit is 200cc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary measure is the degree of clinical improvement among the COVID-19 patients who receive&#xD;
      CPT within seven days as compared with the patients who receive after seven days. Case&#xD;
      Fatality will be assessed among the enrolled cases&#xD;
