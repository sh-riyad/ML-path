  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-swabbing requires less personal protective equipment and could allow to test more people&#xD;
      and even to do quick self-diagnosis if antigenic tests are available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary study on 190 medical students, the investigators have shown that self and&#xD;
      conventional swabbing were identically well-accepted with equivalent level of pain and&#xD;
      discomfort induced by swabbing. In a sub-group of this sample, the investigators have shown&#xD;
      that the quality of the 2 sampling methods were equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this large study in the general population is to confirm these findings in an&#xD;
      adequately powered study. Such results would allow to develop self-swabbing for large&#xD;
      screening campaigns and eventually self-diagnosis using antigenic tests.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All consecutive subjects coming to the 2 dedicated centers for COVID-19 screening in&#xD;
      Clermont-Ferrand University hospital (one for medical students and one for the general&#xD;
      population) will be asked to be included in the present study. They will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either supervised self-swabbing followed by conventional swabbing led by a healthcare&#xD;
      professional or the other way round.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will have to complete a brief questionnaire including demographical&#xD;
      characteristics (age, sex, height, weight, eye color), potential symptoms (asthenia, fever,&#xD;
      anosmia…) anticipated pain and discomfort and previous nasopharyngeal swabbing experience.&#xD;
      Pain, discomfort and overall acceptability of the procedure will be completed just after&#xD;
      completion of the swabbing.&#xD;
