  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who visit an emergency room with ocular symptoms, point-of-care ultrasound can&#xD;
      quickly identify several emergency diseases. While training of eye ultrasound skills is&#xD;
      useful for emergency physicians, hands-on education is risky in pandemic situation such as&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19). As a solution to this, non-face-to-face education via&#xD;
      online has been on the rise. The investigators hypothesized that even an online education is&#xD;
      enough to perform basic eye ultrasound by emergency physician.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Since the eye is an superficial organ, it has excellent access to ultrasound. Also, the eye&#xD;
      has a liquid-filled structure (vitreous body), it is suitable for obtaining some important&#xD;
      findings with bedside ultrasound. In patients who visit an emergency room with ocular&#xD;
      symptoms, point-of-care ultrasound can quickly identify several emergency diseases. While&#xD;
      training of eye ultrasound skills is useful for emergency physicians, hands-on education is&#xD;
      risky in pandemic situation such as COVID19. As a solution to this, non-face-to-face&#xD;
      education via online has been on the rise. The investigators hypothesized that even an online&#xD;
      education is enough to perform basic eye ultrasound by emergency physician.&#xD;

    <description>We make our own guideline to evaluate ocular ultrasound scans. The ocular ultrasound images performed participants are evaluated according to the guideline.&#xD;
We compare the scores of the hands-on group and the online group to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Two ultrasound experts measure the standard patient's ONSD and use it as a reference value.&#xD;
The course of ocular ultrasound scanning involves measuring ONSD. We compare the measured ONSD of the hands-on group and the online group to see if there is a significant difference between the two groups.</description>
