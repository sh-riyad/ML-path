      COVID Related Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the Thales High Temperature Detection (HTD) system with the two&#xD;
      routinely used temperature measurement systems (tympanic and forehead) in patients and staff&#xD;
      in the Emergency Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the diagnostic accuracy of HTD for the measurement of fever, using an&#xD;
           equivalence comparison with the maximum temperature recorded with two routinely used&#xD;
           temperature measurements (tympanic and forehead), margin ±0.2°C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if skin tone is an independent confounding factor in the measurement of&#xD;
           fever using HTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish performance of internal calibration of Thales device&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To power for a definitive Clinical Investigation to determine clinical efficacy and&#xD;
           safety cut off with HTD If results are encouraging the aim would then be to undertake a&#xD;
           clinical investigation in order to get CE marking for use in a clinical setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the fifty years since the emergence of thermal imaging technology, Thales in Glasgow has&#xD;
      built up a world leading capability in the design, manufacture and supply of Thermal Imaging&#xD;
      cameras. In addition to the cameras, Thales in Glasgow has a particular expertise in&#xD;
      developing image processing algorithms (conventional and artificial intelligence based) to&#xD;
      allow the cameras to perform critical user tasks beyond mere imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 [SARS-COV-2] has placed a huge challenge on the world. In response to the crisis,&#xD;
      Thales is engaged in a number of initiatives, including one aimed at the possible application&#xD;
      of thermal imaging cameras to detect people with a fever and hence those who may be suffering&#xD;
      from COVID-19.Fever is a key symptom of covid-19. One of the major limitations of existing&#xD;
      systems is thermographic accuracy. Most current thermographic camera systems offer an&#xD;
      accuracy of ± 0.5°C. This can be reduced to ±0.3°C with the inclusion of a &quot;Black Body&quot;&#xD;
      calibration source, although this limits the portability of the system. Using their unique&#xD;
      knowledge and expertise in high resolution and precision thermal imaging and thermal image&#xD;
      processing, Thales aims to develop a fever screening system with an accuracy of ± 0.1°C to&#xD;
      enable more effective identification and triage of people with fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What Thales lacks is real world thermal images of patients suffering fever and access to&#xD;
      clinicians who can advise on the medical aspects of the work. This research would fill these&#xD;
      two voids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pilot study conducted in the Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital&#xD;
      (20/NS/0064), the Thales High Temperature Detection (HTD) system was found to be more&#xD;
      accurate than a tympanic thermometer which captures Infrared radiation emitted by the&#xD;
      tympanic membrane in the ear or forehead thermometer. Tympanic temperature measurements are&#xD;
      typically used in the hospital setting in Scotland whereas forehead IR measurement is common&#xD;
      in transportation and workplace settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HTD has been redesigned in response to three key findings from the pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relative temperature of some facial features correlated more strongly with tympanic&#xD;
           temperature than others.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having an external Black Body (BB) calibration source in the scene at all times was&#xD;
           impractical in a clinical environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Camera systems require to be compact and portable to be useful to clinical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, the HTD is now significantly reduced in size, including peripheral devices. A&#xD;
      novel calibration solution has been designed (and patented) that not only removes the need&#xD;
      for the black body source but allows for a more accurate temperature evaluation. In addition,&#xD;
      facial feature detection has been integrated into the software to allow it to automatically&#xD;
      locate the patient's head and in the near future, automatically determine the temperatures of&#xD;
      individual facial features. This development will capture facial feature detection - not&#xD;
      facial recognition.&#xD;
