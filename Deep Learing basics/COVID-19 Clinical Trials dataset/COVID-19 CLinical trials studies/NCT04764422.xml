      This study will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 designed to evaluate safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and immunogenicity COVID-19 vaccine (NDV-HXP-S) administered at different doses levels (1, 3,&#xD;
      and 10 µg) without adjuvant, and at two different dose levels (1 and 3 µg) with the adjuvant&#xD;
      CpG 1018 among healthy adults, (age 18-59 years) (210 subjects). Subjects will receive 2&#xD;
      doses of assigned investigational product (IP) on D1 and D29 (V1 and V3), and be assessed in&#xD;
      clinic for safety and reactogenicity at 7 days after each vaccination (day 1 as day&#xD;
      vaccination). An interim analysis of Phase 1 data will be conducted as the basis for&#xD;
      decisions about advancement to Phase 2 of the study and about treatment group down selection.&#xD;
      Phase 2 (250 subjects) will include approximately one-third subjects with age 60-75 years.&#xD;

      This study (GPO NDV-HXP-S) will be conducted in 2 phases. Phase 1 will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and immunogenicity COVID-19 vaccine (NDV-HXP-S) administered at different doses&#xD;
      levels (1, 3, and 10 µg) without adjuvant, and at two different dose levels (1 and 3 µg) with&#xD;
      the adjuvant CpG 1018 among healthy adults, (age 18-59 years, 210 subjects). NDV-HXP-S or&#xD;
      placebo (0.9% normal saline for injection) will administered IM according to a repeat&#xD;
      vaccination schedule (given 28 days apart). In addition, as exploratory objectives, a total&#xD;
      of 36 subjects will be randomly selected (1:1:1 ratio) from placebo and two high-dose groups&#xD;
      i.e. NDV-HXP-S 10 µg and NDV-HXP-S 3 µg + CpG 1018, to provide additional blood at V1, V5 and&#xD;
      V7 for assessment of T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI). An interim analysis of Phase 1 data will&#xD;
      be conducted as the basis for decisions about advancement to Phase 2 of the study and about&#xD;
      treatment group down selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Phase 2 study, 250 subjects aged 18-75 years will be randomized (1:2:2) to placebo&#xD;
      (0.9% normal saline for injection), or one of two selected formulations of NDV HXP S being&#xD;
      evaluated in Phase 1 will be enrolled to Phase 2 study. Twelve subjects in each of the three&#xD;
      Phase 2 groups (distributed among the two age strata) will be will be randomized to provide&#xD;
      additional blood at V1, V5 and V7 for assessment of T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Unblinded study staff, including the site pharmacist, will be responsible for preparing study products (in accordance with the randomly determined assignment), administering the study vaccine, and handling all drug accountability procedures. These personnel will not participate in the other aspects of the clinical trial, to help ensure the integrity of the blind at the site. Unblinded staff will retrieve a subject's randomization assignment after being informed by the PI or designee that a subject is eligible for randomization. They will prepare the 0.5 ml dose of study product based on the subject's randomization</masking_description>
