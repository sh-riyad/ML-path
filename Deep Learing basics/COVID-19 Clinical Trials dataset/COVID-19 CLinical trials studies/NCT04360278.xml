      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major public health issue. Researchers&#xD;
      want to collect plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19, and use this plasma to&#xD;
      treat people who are sick with the disease. The plasma will have antibodies against the virus&#xD;
      that causes COVID-19. Persons who have received a COVID-19 vaccine may also donate plasma&#xD;
      that contains antibodies against the virus if they meet criteria according to the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 or have been vaccinated&#xD;
      against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, so that the plasma can be used to treat people&#xD;
      with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have been diagnosed with, and have recovered from, COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and blood sample. Their&#xD;
      pulse, blood pressure, and temperature will be taken. Their height and weight will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will donate plasma. It will be collected through whole blood donation or through&#xD;
      apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For whole blood donation, a needle will be placed in the participant s arm vein. Blood will&#xD;
      be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For apheresis, a needle will be placed in the participant s arm vein. Blood will be&#xD;
      withdrawn. A machine will separate the plasma from the red cells. The plasma will be removed,&#xD;
      and the rest of the cells will be returned to the participant either through the same needle&#xD;
      or through a needle in their other arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 to 20 plasma donations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 3 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging infectious diseases such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic cause&#xD;
      substantial morbidity and mortality. During the early emergent phases of such diseases, there&#xD;
      is often no vaccine to prevent infection, nor specific therapeutic agent to treat the&#xD;
      disease. The objective of this protocol is the collection of immune plasma from persons&#xD;
      post-recovery from COVID-19 or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. This plasma may potentially be&#xD;
      used in the treatment or prophylaxis of active COVID-19 under other protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be screened for eligibility to participate in plasma donations and their&#xD;
      blood levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Enrolled subjects will receive a baseline physical&#xD;
      and laboratory examination. Subjects with sufficient anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers who meet&#xD;
      standard blood bank criteria for plasma donation will then be scheduled for plasma&#xD;
      collections. Plasmapheresis is the preferred method of collection, with up to 800 mL of&#xD;
      plasma collected per donation depending on the weight of the donor. Collected immune plasma&#xD;
      will be tested for blood-borne pathogens, and stored according to standard blood bank&#xD;
      procedures. The scope of this protocol is limited to collection of plasma from subjects with&#xD;
      sufficiently high anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titer. Any administration of&#xD;
&#xD;
      convalescent immune plasma to subjects will be performed under a separate protocol.&#xD;
