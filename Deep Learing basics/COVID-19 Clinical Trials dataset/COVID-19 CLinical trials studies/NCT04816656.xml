  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients with cancer are subject to multiple risks (e.g.&#xD;
      frequent hospital visits, increased infection risk, more severe clinical course, discontinued&#xD;
      cancer treatment etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing cancer therapy are also faced with several Quality of Life - impairing&#xD;
      side effects. In the case of a positive COVID-19 cancer patient, the need and intensity of&#xD;
      treating must be weighed against the possible higher risk of developing severe complications&#xD;
      in the course of a COVID-19 infection. Nevertheless, both for COVID-19 positive and negative&#xD;
      patients who will continue or discontinue cancer treatment throughout the pandemic, providing&#xD;
      supportive care is more important than ever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digitally monitoring patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) could offer a solution to&#xD;
      improve the supportive care measures during cancer treatment, and certainly in times of&#xD;
      COVID-19. Digitalized PROMS could significantly contribute to improved communication, patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, supportive care, monitoring of cancer treatment, and detection of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, clinical trials investigating the benefits of digital PROMS in patients with cancer&#xD;
      during the current COVID-19 pandemic are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Jessa Hospital, the investigators already have experience in collecting PROMs via a&#xD;
      digital platform (Awell Health) since 2019 for patients with breast cancer undergoing&#xD;
      chemotherapy using validated QoL questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate the impact of a COVID-19&#xD;
      infection on the severity of the cancer therapy-related complications and the QoL of patients&#xD;
      with cancer undergoing chemotherapy using a digital PROMs-platform.&#xD;

      General aim: The overall aim of this project is to prospectively evaluate the impact of a&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection on the severity of the cancer therapy-related complications and the QoL of&#xD;
      patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy using a digital PROMs platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Evaluate the effect of a COVID-19 infection on the severity of cancer&#xD;
      therapy-related side effects and patients' QoL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The functionality of this platform will be based on three main principles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The digital PROMs platform will provide patient-tailored information throughout the&#xD;
           course of their disease and up to one month after the end of their chemotherapy&#xD;
           concerning complications and COVID-19. This will support the cancer patients during&#xD;
           their disease with specific advice based on the side effects they document. First, this&#xD;
           will help comfort patients and reduce their anxiety and insecurity in these stressful&#xD;
           times. Second, they will receive information regarding measures they can take to tackle&#xD;
           their specific complications. Third, this will encourage patients to seek help in case&#xD;
           of a possible COVID-19 infection and/or severe side effects by contacting the&#xD;
           oncological support team or their physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The platform will prospectively collect QoL data using validated patient-reported&#xD;
           questionnaires and specific COVID-19 questionnaires via a mobile application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The platform will be fully integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) of the&#xD;
           patient and will provide a structured report of the questioned complications for the&#xD;
           physician. This will allow the medical oncologist to monitor the medical journey of the&#xD;
           patient during and up to one month after their chemotherapy. As such, the medical&#xD;
           oncologist can finetune the cancer treatment and supportive care measures towards the&#xD;
           needs of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: &quot;An COVID-19 infection will aggravate the severity of the cancer therapy-related&#xD;
      complications and thereby diminish the patients' QoL.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Evaluate the patient benefit of digital PROMS platform Rationale: The&#xD;
      implementation of a digital PROMs platform for cancer patients has demonstrated multiple&#xD;
      benefits in the past, ranging from enhanced patient satisfaction, detection of unrecognized&#xD;
      problems, earlier detection of complications, and/or more specific supportive care measures&#xD;
      leading to an improved treatment outcome and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: &quot;The use of a digital PROMs platform for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to (1) an improved patient satisfaction and general&#xD;
      knowledge on the oncologic supportive care measures and (2) a reduction in patient distress&#xD;
      and anxiety&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General approach (for both objectives): A prospective, cohort study will be set up in&#xD;
      patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Patients will be stratified during treatment in&#xD;
      two groups: (1) COVID-19 positive and (2) negative patients. Patients will be instructed to&#xD;
      fill in validated Qol, distress/anxiety, and COVID-19 specific questionnaires via a digital&#xD;
      platform from the day of inclusion up to 1-month post-chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>At inclusion the patient received a unique login code which he/she used to start the care path. After signing the informed consent on the digital pathway, the patient needed to fill in the questionnaires that were presented at fixed time points throughout this study.&#xD;
Based on the data collected from the questionnaires the patient received customized information and advice. In case of COVID-19, the information and advice was based on the guidelines from Sciensano and the Belgian government. If the patient suffered from side effects from the cancer therapy, they received tips and tricks how to manage these complications. The collected data was forwarded to the patient medical file. As such health care workers were be able to use this information in the patients' follow up consultations.</description>
