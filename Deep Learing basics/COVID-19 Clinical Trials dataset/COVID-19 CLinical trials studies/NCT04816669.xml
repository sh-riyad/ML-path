  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of lyophilized BNT162b2&#xD;
      presented in single-dose vials and of frozen liquid BNT162b2 in multidose vials and&#xD;
      demonstrate that the immune response of the lyophilized formulation is noninferior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a 2-dose schedule (separated by 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At a dose of 30µg (as studied in the Phase 2/3 study C4591001)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In healthy adults 18 through 55 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 2 months (3 visits&#xD;
           in total)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study will be conducted in the United States&#xD;
