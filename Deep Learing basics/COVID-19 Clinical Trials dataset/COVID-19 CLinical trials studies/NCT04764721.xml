      Patients with Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 19) may experience multiple neurological symptoms&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET-CT ( Positons EmissionTomography coupled with a Computer Tomography with&#xD;
      flurodesoxyglucose labelled with fluor 18), which reflects neuronal glycolytic metabolism,&#xD;
      shows early variations in neuronal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the tropism of Covid-19 is essentially pulmonary and the hypothesis of this study is&#xD;
      with 18F-FDG PET-CT it's possible to study the relationship between cerebral metabolism and&#xD;
      the metabolism of pulmonary lesions following Covid-19 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Covid-19 may experience multiple neurological symptoms including confusion and&#xD;
      headaches (non-specific neurological symptoms), while others develop specific neurological&#xD;
      manifestations, including stroke, related to increased bleeding disorders, seizures and signs&#xD;
      of encephalitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The coronavirus enters the central nervous system through the olfactory bulb, causing&#xD;
      olfactory and taste dysfunctions. These symptoms may appear before, during or even after the&#xD;
      general symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, 18F-FDG PET-CT, which reflects neuronal glycolytic metabolism, shows early variations&#xD;
      in neuronal function, even in the absence of morphological changes visualized by MRI&#xD;
      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover the tropism of Covid-19 is essentially pulmonary and it is accepted that acute&#xD;
      pulmonary lesions are independent risk factors for cerebral hypoxia. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      cytokine storm due to COVID-19 and the resulting hyperinflammation state may induce a&#xD;
      transient increase in pressure, with endothelial and vascular lesions and increased capillary&#xD;
      permeability, and promote pulmonary oedema leading to secondary cerebral damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung/brain relationship is therefore essential to be studied in pathologies whose main&#xD;
      tropism is the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET has the advantage of being able to explore both cerebral metabolism and the&#xD;
      metabolism of COVID-19-related lung lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that 18F-FDG PET-CT can objectify and characterize central&#xD;
      nervous system involvement in Covid-19 infection. It also makes it possible to study the&#xD;
      relationship between cerebral metabolism and the metabolism of pulmonary lesions following&#xD;
      Covid-19 infection.&#xD;
