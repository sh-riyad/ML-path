      Objectives To assess the reactogenicity, measure the adaptive immune responses and track the&#xD;
      long-term immune memory in 11-16-year-old young adolescents and their parents receiving the 3&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines-BNT162b2, CoronaVac and AZD1222-chosen by the Hong Kong Government; to&#xD;
      compare the reactogenicity and immunogenicity across the 3 vaccines used for these children&#xD;
      and their respective parents, and between the children and their parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested The safety profile and the magnitude and durability of immune&#xD;
      responses to the 3 COVID-19 vaccines in young adolescents are non-inferior to those in&#xD;
      middle-aged adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects A single-site, comparative nonrandomised clinical trial for 300 healthy&#xD;
      individuals between 11-16 years old paired with one or both healthy parents to receive one of&#xD;
      3 COVID-19 vaccines-100 student-parent pairs for each vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments Mobile app for subjects to record adverse effects, enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay, plaque reduction neutralization assay, luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay and&#xD;
      flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions BNT162b2, CoronaVac and AZD1222.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures Types and frequencies of adverse effects within 7 days, and changes and&#xD;
      peaks of antibody levels and antigen-specific memory T cell responses for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Comparison of rates of each type of adverse effects, immune responses at each&#xD;
      timepoint across the 3 vaccines and age groups by ANOVA and multivariate longitudinal&#xD;
      statistical models, decay of immune response modelled by regression analysis.&#xD;
