  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study is a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population to be treated are patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection confirmed by positive standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (or equivalent/&#xD;
      other approved diagnostic test) within 4 days prior to starting study treatment, and&#xD;
      hospitalized with respiratory distress but not yet requiring high-level respiratory support&#xD;
      (as defined in exclusion criterion #2). See inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening/ Baseline visit (Day -1 to 1): Lasts up to 24-48 hours and comprises&#xD;
           screening/ baseline assessments. This visit will confirm that study inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria are met by participants prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment period (Day 1-3 with potential to expand to Day 4-5): Randomized subjects will&#xD;
           receive blinded study treatment once daily for 3 days by IV infusion, in addition to&#xD;
           SoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period (Day 4-6 through Day 60): Subjects will be assessed daily while&#xD;
           hospitalized. Discharged patients will be asked to attend study visits at Days 15 and&#xD;
           29. A follow-up visit at Day 60(Â±10), by telephone call, is also included to confirm&#xD;
           patient status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a series of efficacy and safety assessments, including laboratory&#xD;
      assays. Additional blood samples and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs will also be obtained&#xD;
      (oropharyngeal (OP) swabs to be collected only in exceptional circumstances).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with 3 days of study drug administration. After an interim analysis&#xD;
      safety review, by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), dosing may be extended to 5&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
