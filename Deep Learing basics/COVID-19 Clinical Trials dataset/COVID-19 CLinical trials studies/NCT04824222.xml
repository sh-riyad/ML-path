  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gut microbiota provides an intestinal biological barrier against pathogens and has a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis and modulation of the host immune&#xD;
      system. The gut microbiota in a dysbiotic state has increasingly been implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis and progression of numerous diseases. However, whether dysbiosis reflects&#xD;
      changes caused by the disease itself, or should be considered as a driving step in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis, is not always understood. Dysbiosis results in the disturbance of several&#xD;
      metabolic pathways that influence immunological and mechanical processes both in and outside&#xD;
      the intestine, and it impairs colonization resistance. These processes may be reverted by&#xD;
      fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). FMT is a type of treatment that relies on&#xD;
      transferring the microbiota that targets and corrects intestinal dysbiosis. FMT is based on&#xD;
      collecting stool from healthy donors and - after preparation - administering the material to&#xD;
      an individual with a specific disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, a subset of the symptoms associated with COVID-19 during the initial phase are&#xD;
      intestinal complications, such as vomiting or diarrhea. Detecting these symptoms might not&#xD;
      only lead to slowdown in transmission but also open the door to novel treatments that could&#xD;
      reduce the severity of COVID-19.There is a positive correlation between severity of patient&#xD;
      condition and level of proinflammatory cytokines (cytokine storm) in group of patients with&#xD;
      COVID 19. Though numerous studies have been published on FMT for the treatment of certain&#xD;
      diseases, there are only scarce studies on FMT for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral&#xD;
      mechanism depended on the gut-lung axis was intimately proved in case of flu virus. The same&#xD;
      dependency is observed in SARS CoV2 as well. That seems, good condition of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota could impact on antiviral effects and inhibits replication of virus. This leads to&#xD;
      inhibit progress of inflammatory process in lung tissue. Silencing of inflammatory process&#xD;
      through reestablish right influence of gut-lung axis could be fundamental meaning in&#xD;
      arresting of cytokines storm and development of ARDS in patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scientist rationale definitely argue a clear need to studies of gut wellbeing in COVID 19&#xD;
      and using FMT to reduce development of COVID 19. According to our knowledge FeMToCOVID will&#xD;
      be the first clinical trial with using of FMT in COVID 19. We postulate FMT in the beginning&#xD;
      of cytokine storm during CIVUD-19 may act as an immunomodulation and stop the progression of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
