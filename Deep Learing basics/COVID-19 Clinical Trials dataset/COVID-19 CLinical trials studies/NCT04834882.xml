  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus detected&#xD;
      in Wuhan, China on December 2019. This virus is responsible for the infectious respiratory&#xD;
      disease called Covid-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological effects of this epidemic are found among the general population, but also&#xD;
      healthcare workers. Some studies have shown that psychological disorders such as stress,&#xD;
      anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear, post-traumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder are emerging among healthcare workers. However, there is currently insufficient data&#xD;
      to evaluate the burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to understand the impact of the covid-19 epidemic on stress and&#xD;
      burnout on healthcare workers and their coping strategies.&#xD;

      Burnout syndrome, a state of professional exhaustion, is prevalent among the medical and&#xD;
      paramedical staff. The covid-19 pandemic may generate more stress and increase the risk for&#xD;
      burnout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate burnout (prevalence and intensity) and stress of among&#xD;
      healthcare workers in COVID-19 units and non COVID-19 units. We also explore the supportive&#xD;
      coping strategies need to reduce their stress and burnout.&#xD;
