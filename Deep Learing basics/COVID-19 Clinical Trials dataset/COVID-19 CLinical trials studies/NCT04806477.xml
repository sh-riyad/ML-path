  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study that sought to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of the telemedicine&#xD;
      consultation of patients suspected of respiratory tract infections during COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      in comparison with the face-to-face evaluation at the emergency department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unicentric, prospective and randomized study performed between September and November 2020&#xD;
      with adult patients who sought care at emergency department. The inclusion criterion was the&#xD;
      exhibition of any tract respiratory symptom. Patients older than 65 years, with chronic heart&#xD;
      or lung diseases or immunosuppressed were excluded. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 for&#xD;
      a brief telemedicine consultation, blinded to subsequent face-to-face evaluation or direct&#xD;
      face-to-face evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>All institutional Emergency Department or Telemedicine assessments involve filling out the final diagnosis on an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10)-code basis in the electronic medical record before discharge to home or admission. For aggregation of most prevalent RTI with similar pathophysiologic characteristics, three diagnostic groups were defined, based on ICD 10 codes: RTI, including COVID-19 (B34.2, B34.9, B97.2, J00, J04, J06, J11, J20, J30, J39, U07.1); PT - Acute Pharyngotonsillitis (J02-J03.9) and AS - Acute Sinusitis (J01-J01.9).</description>
