      Detailed description: SARS-Covid-19 virus pandemic has had a big impact both socially and on&#xD;
      operation of health facilities. During the Covid-19 outbreak most of the scheduled&#xD;
      endoscopies were cancelled and only emergent and urgent endoscopies were performed in the&#xD;
      unit. This meant that for six weeks, around 98% of our daily workload was cancelled. During&#xD;
      that time the investigators have developed a protocol in order to resume scheduled endoscopic&#xD;
      activity in the decreasing phase of the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this prospective observational study is that implementation of a protocol&#xD;
      based upon Covid PCR tests and clinical triage is useful to categorize two types of Covid-19&#xD;
      infection risk and two levels of personal protection equipments required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to evaluate the outcomes of implementing a protective protocol with two&#xD;
      levels of protection for Covid-19 in the endoscopy unit. As secondary aims, the&#xD;
      investigators, want to evaluate the endoscopy unit staff and patients infection rate after&#xD;
      implementation of the protective protocol; and the utility of previous Covid PCR testing and&#xD;
      on day clinical triage to discriminate patients before endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A brief daily questionnaire will be filled by all the endoscopy unit staff members&#xD;
      questioning about type of procedures performed in their allocated endoscopy room, level of&#xD;
      protection used and PCR status of their attended patients. Patients will be followed up for a&#xD;
      period of two weeks to discard development of Covid-19 disease with possible origin in their&#xD;
      visit to the endoscopy unit.&#xD;
