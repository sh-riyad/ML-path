  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ice swimming is an increasingly common phenomenon in Poland. It has been confirmed that it&#xD;
      has a beneficial effect on health by increasing the natural non-specific immunity to&#xD;
      infections. In the face of the current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), researchers decided to use&#xD;
      a survey to check the incidence of COVID-19 among Polish ice swimmers, as well as recent&#xD;
      ailments. Then, the researchers will compare the obtained results with epidemiological data&#xD;
      for Poland.Researchers will also investigate the relationship between susceptibility to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection and the blood group and Rh factor among ice swimmers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research tool is an original questionnaire compiled by a team of experts conducting the&#xD;
      study. The survey includes questions about sociodemographic data, such as age and gender and&#xD;
      blood type in AB0 system with Rh factor, and questions about the frequency of ice swimming,&#xD;
      the duration of a single session, and since when respondents have been ice swimming. There&#xD;
      was also a question about the respondents' compliance with the restrictions and&#xD;
      recommendations related to the pandemic and contacts with people with confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection. In the survey, researchers ask about the infectious symptoms experienced during&#xD;
      the pandemic and about being diagnosed with COVID-19 or its exclusion. People who have been&#xD;
      ill are asked about the place of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires are collected in traditional form, on the Internet and as scans of&#xD;
      documents. Each survey was completely anonymous. The obtained statistical data will be&#xD;
      compared with official data on new COVID-19 cases and recoveries at the same time. Official&#xD;
      data are published by the Ministry of Health and earlier also by Sanitary and Epidemiological&#xD;
      Stations. The main aim of the study was to determine whether ice swimming also increases&#xD;
      resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.&#xD;
