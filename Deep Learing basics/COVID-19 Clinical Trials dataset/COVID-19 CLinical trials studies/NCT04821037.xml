  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frontline nurses increasingly face challenges between executing their jobs to the best of&#xD;
      their ability and caring for their own physical and mental health. Such a stressful and&#xD;
      fast-changing work environment impacts the nurses' psychological wellbeing, resulting in high&#xD;
      levels of stress and burnout, which in turn negatively affects patient care and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether a short virtual intervention, based on&#xD;
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and adapted to caregivers, can lead to a reduction in&#xD;
      psychological distress that may be associated with caregiving during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be held online in a group setting during two half-day workshops using a&#xD;
      conference application (e.g. Zoom).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note: This study is part of an international joint research project &quot;Nurse Health&quot; between&#xD;
      the Faculty of Psychology (University of Basel) and the Nethersole School of Nursing (Chinese&#xD;
      University of Hong Kong), funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and&#xD;
      Innovation (SERI), with the Leading House for the Bilateral Science and Technology&#xD;
      Cooperation Programme with Asia at ETH ZÃ¼rich (Project No. COV_09_062020).&#xD;

    <description>A digitally-based ACT program will be conducted in two half-day workshops via meeting software (e.g. Zoom) consisting of:&#xD;
mindfulness exercises, for stress reduction and to guide nurses to observe their painful thoughts and feelings that they are attempting to avoid;&#xD;
ACT-metaphors, to let nurses realize the cost of struggling with psychological distress often create more distress;&#xD;
experiential exercises, to guide nurses to notice their own experiences in providing nursing care throughout their nursing career and explore any special qualities;&#xD;
explore the nurses' values with respect to different areas in their lives.</description>
