  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ear-loop-type Korean Filter 94 masks (KF94 masks, equivalent to the N95 and FFP2) are broadly&#xD;
      used in health care settings in Korea for the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no studies have&#xD;
      assessed the adequacy of respiratory protection. In this prospective randomized open-label&#xD;
      study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the fitting performance of ear-loop-type KF94&#xD;
      masks by the quantitative fit test according to the occupational safety and health&#xD;
      administration (OSHA) protocol. In addition, by quantitatively comparing the &quot;tight-fitting&quot;&#xD;
      method using a clip and the &quot;general-fitting&quot; method, the investigators tried to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the tight-wearing method improves the fitting performance of KF94 masks.&#xD;

      Sample size: The sample size was calculated based on a pilot study of 10 participants, which&#xD;
      examined the FF of general-fitting. The mean FF was 20.3, and the log-transformed FFs were&#xD;
      assessed due to skewed data, which was 1.98 (standard deviation 1.34). We assumed that the FF&#xD;
      for tight-fitting would increase by 50%, with an α value of .05, and a β error of .10 (power&#xD;
      = 90%) for two-sided hypothesis testing. The estimated sample size calculation revealed a&#xD;
      required sample of 24 participants. Therefore, 30 participants were enrolled to account for a&#xD;
      20% dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analyses: Repeated-measures analysis of variance or generalized estimating equations&#xD;
      were used to compare the FFs or passing rate of the QNFTs for the three mask types according&#xD;
      to the wearing method. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare the&#xD;
      FFs according to the wearing method for each mask type. McNemar's test was used to compare&#xD;
      the passing rate of the QNFT according to the wearing method. Bonferroni's correction was&#xD;
      performed for all results of each subgroup analysis. SAS ver. 9.4 software (SAS Institute,&#xD;
      Cary, NC) was used to perform all statistical analyses.&#xD;
