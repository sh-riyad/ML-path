  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if a check-list including lung ultrasonography can help&#xD;
      to identify the etiology of the acute respiratory failure of patients managed at the&#xD;
      emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients admitted to the emergency room for acute respiratory failure will be offered&#xD;
      the study. The emergency physician will perform a systematic examination using a checklist,&#xD;
      including pulmonary embolism prediction scores, structured clinical examination and lung&#xD;
      ultrasound, in order to establish a diagnostic hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic hypothesis will be made after completion of the checklist. The emergency&#xD;
      physician can perform additional examinations and treatment after completion of the&#xD;
      checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final diagnosis will be checked by an adjudication committee which will have all the&#xD;
      documents established during the emergency room consultation and any hospitalization&#xD;
      following this hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome will be the concordance rate between the diagnosis after the check-list and&#xD;
      the final diagnosis.&#xD;

    <description>The investigator will follow the checklist which includes the collection of anamnestic data and clinical signs, the performance of a pulmonary embolism clinical probability score and a cardiopulmonary ultrasound with count -standardized rendering. After completing this checklist, the investigator will note their diagnosis (list of proposals on the data collection sheet), the treatments started (closed list of therapeutic classes). If he orders other tests, he will write them down and then note the diagnosis made and the treatments prescribed after obtaining the results of these tests.&#xD;
The therapeutic management of patients compared to the usual care in the respective departments may be modified depending on the results of the cardiopulmonary ultrasound . The emergency physician may initiate therapy before the results of additional examinations that he would have usually performed without cardiopulmonary ultrasound.</description>
