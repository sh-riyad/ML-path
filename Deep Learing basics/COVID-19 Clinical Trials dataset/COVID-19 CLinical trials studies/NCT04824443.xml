  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 30-week aerobic&#xD;
      exercise therapy program in cancer patients recovering from COVID-19. The study will look at&#xD;
      whether the aerobic exercise therapy causes few or mild side effects in participants. Aerobic&#xD;
      exercise is physical activity that uses the large muscle groups (muscles in your legs,&#xD;
      buttocks, back, and chest) and can be performed for several minutes at a time. The aerobic&#xD;
      exercise therapy being used in this study will be a walking program that will be adjusted so&#xD;
      it matches participant fitness levels (how much exercise you can handle).&#xD;

    <description>Aerobic Exercise Therapy/AT will consist of 30 weeks of treadmill walking sessions. AT will consist of supervised, individualized walking delivered up to 6 times weekly (over a 7-day period) to achieve a cumulative total duration ranging from 90 mins/wk up to 375 mins/wk following a non-linear dosing schedule. The planned dose and scheduling of AT will be continually altered and progressed in conjunction with appropriate rest/recovery sessions across the entire intervention period (i.e., non-linear periodized schedule).</description>
