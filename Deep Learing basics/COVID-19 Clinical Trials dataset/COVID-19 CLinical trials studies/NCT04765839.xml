    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized trial will be conducted prior to widespread vaccine availability to the&#xD;
      general public. Community-informed COVID-19 vaccine messages will be disseminated to&#xD;
      participants. At baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, the study team will survey participants to&#xD;
      assess knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines, including intention to be vaccinated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cluster randomized trial with 80 participants from the social networks of 8 CLs will be&#xD;
      conducted prior to widespread vaccine availability to the general public. Four CLs and social&#xD;
      networks (cluster of 10 per network) will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention&#xD;
      immediately or after a delay of 2 weeks. Intervention participants will be invited to a&#xD;
      closed social media group on the platform of their choice. CLs, selected for trustworthiness&#xD;
      within vulnerable populations, will disseminate community-informed COVID-19 vaccine messages&#xD;
      to members of their social networks and engage in bidirectional communication with CEnR&#xD;
      partners to refine messages. At baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks, participants will be surveyed&#xD;
      to assess knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19 vaccines, including intention to be&#xD;
      vaccinated.&#xD;
