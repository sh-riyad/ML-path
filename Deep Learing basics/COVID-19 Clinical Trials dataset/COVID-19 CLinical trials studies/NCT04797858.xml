  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19, the coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2), has led to a global pandemic and has exacerbated existing health inequities&#xD;
      among vulnerable populations. Despite higher rates of COVID-19 in Black and Latinx&#xD;
      individuals compared to White individuals, rates of testing in predominately non-White,&#xD;
      low-income communities are significantly lower than in high-income areas. Self-testing, where&#xD;
      individuals collect their own samples, is now feasible for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. One&#xD;
      promising approach to increase test uptake is the secondary distribution of self-testing&#xD;
      kits, where an individual distributes tests to contacts in their social network and&#xD;
      encourages them to self-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis of this clinical trial is that the secondary distribution of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 self-tests can significantly expand test uptake among underserved populations. To&#xD;
      test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a 1:1 randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      will assess a self-testing intervention that promotes the secondary distribution of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 test kits compared with test referrals, with a focus on reaching underserved&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to rapidly disseminate COVID-19 testing are urgently needed, particularly to&#xD;
      address increasing health disparities among underserved communities. One promising approach&#xD;
      to increase test uptake is the secondary distribution of self-tests, where an individual&#xD;
      distributes test kits to contacts in their social network and encourages them to self-test.&#xD;
      By decentralizing testing, this approach does not require individuals to have contact with&#xD;
      medical systems, and can lower potential barriers to obtaining testing. This approach can&#xD;
      increase case detection by facilitating testing among exposed individuals, and potentially&#xD;
      ameliorate stigma, fear, and medical mistrust associated with COVID-19 among vulnerable&#xD;
      populations because the testing process is decentralized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a 1:1 randomized controlled trial randomizing individuals to&#xD;
      receive either multiple self-test kits to distribute within their social circles, or&#xD;
      referrals for standard clinic-based tests. All study participants will be offered testing&#xD;
      upon enrollment. Study participants, deemed &quot;Index Participants,&quot; will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive multiple self-testing kits (intervention) or test referral cards and text messages&#xD;
      (control) to encourage individuals in their social networks, deemed &quot;network contacts&quot; to&#xD;
      test. Participants will complete a baseline evaluation and a follow-up evaluation at 8 weeks.&#xD;
      We will measure network contact test uptake in both study arms. The central hypothesis of&#xD;
      this trial is that distribution of self-test kits will increase test uptake compared with&#xD;
      distribution of test referrals.&#xD;
