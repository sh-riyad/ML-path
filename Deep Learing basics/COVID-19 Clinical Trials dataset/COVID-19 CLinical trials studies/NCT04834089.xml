      Phase I/II Randomized Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy of&#xD;
      Anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients at early stage of COVID-19 with increased risk for severe&#xD;
      disease due to underlying medical conditions to determine the utility of an equine&#xD;
      heterologous serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 to avoid progression to a severe COVID-19&#xD;

      Phase I/II Clinical Trial, randomized, multicentric, on three stages (A, B and C) to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum and dose escalation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be in three stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage A: 30 kidney transplanted participants (very high risk), where 15 will received 1 vial&#xD;
      (5 mL) and 15 will received 2 vials (10 mL) of serum;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage B: 30 immunocompetent participants with at least 2 risk factors for severe disease&#xD;
      (high risk) who will receive the dose selected by stage A;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage C: 558 participants, of very high risk and high risk, compared with placebo in&#xD;
      allocation 2:1 (endpoint-driven design)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation type Open study without allocation of randomization on Stages A and B Randomized&#xD;
      allocation with placebo comparator in Stage C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Status: On planning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Date of 1st recruitment Expected: April 2021&#xD;

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>Stage C of this study was designed as double-blind to avoid the bias introduction in the efficacy and adverse events evaluation. The clinical care team, the responsible professional for administering the serum and the participant will not know which product under investigation will be administered. Only the pharmacists or nurses responsible for the randomization of the study, separation and blinding of the product under investigation will have access to unblinded information. The allocation of the product under investigation will only be revealed after the completion of the participants' following up and database closing to guarantee a long-term safety evaluation of the product. The sponsor's operational team will also remain blind.&#xD;
If necessary, independent scientists not involved with the clinical or laboratory evaluation of the participants, who analyze the unblinded data of laboratory results.</masking_description>
