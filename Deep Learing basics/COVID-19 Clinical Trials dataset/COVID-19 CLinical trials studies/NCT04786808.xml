  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 pandemic has deeply burdened hospitals all over the world. A two-stage disease has&#xD;
      been hypothesized due to quick worsening of clinical status after 7-10 days from the&#xD;
      beginning of first symptoms, generally flu-like symptoms. Predicting clinical worsening could&#xD;
      help to address major efforts towards higher risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the last year most observational studies, generally retrospective, has been conducted,&#xD;
      identifying some risk factors such as age, obesity, male gender, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      COPD, diabetes etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study goal is to collect systematically a variegate amount of clinical, biometric,&#xD;
      laboratory and radiological data from patients admitted to the Emergency Medicine Ward of&#xD;
      Piacenza Hospital (Italy), in order to prospectively analyze what characteristics are&#xD;
      associated to higher risk of mortality.&#xD;

        All patients admitted to the ward from the Emergency Department are proposed to participate&#xD;
        to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients admitted to the Emergency Medicine Ward have a COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory&#xD;
        failure at any stage of severity, with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio approximately between 100 and 300.&#xD;
        Prevalence of severe cases changes according to the number of cases diagnosed in the&#xD;
        community and consequently to the global number of admissions to the hospital. The study is&#xD;
        intended to be conducted over a period of 1 year.&#xD;
