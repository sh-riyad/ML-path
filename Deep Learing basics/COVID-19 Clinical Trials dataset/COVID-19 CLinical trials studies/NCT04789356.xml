  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a quasi-experimental study with risk-based allocation. Public security and education&#xD;
      professionals from the state government will be included. In the initial evaluation, the&#xD;
      presence of comorbidities associated with an increased risk of serious disease due to&#xD;
      COVID-19 will be evaluated, according to the national plan for the implementation of&#xD;
      vaccination against COVID-19. Those with at least one of these comorbidities will be invited&#xD;
      to receive the study vaccine in two doses, with an interval of 28 days (±7 days).&#xD;
      Participants with low risk (without comorbidities as a risk factor for severe COVID-19&#xD;
      according to the national plan for the implementation of vaccination against COVID-19) will&#xD;
      not receive the vaccine within the scope of the research project. If, after 12 months, the&#xD;
      participant in the low-risk group (no vaccine) has not received CoronaVac, or any other&#xD;
      vaccine available, he/she will receive the vaccine, exactly as offered in the other group&#xD;
      (two doses of CoronaVac with an interval of 28 days - with a tolerance of 7 days before or&#xD;
      after). All participants will be followed up for 12 months from inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Immunization is expected to reduce the risk of moderate to severe disease of those with&#xD;
      comorbidities to the level of those of the same age group who do not have these comorbidities&#xD;
      but face similar occupational risks.&#xD;
