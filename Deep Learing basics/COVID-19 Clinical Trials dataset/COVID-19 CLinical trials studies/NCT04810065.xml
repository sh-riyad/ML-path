  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence is emerging that many individuals who recover from Covid-19 are experiencing a range&#xD;
      of residual problems. These include fatigue, pain, reduced exercise tolerance and breathing&#xD;
      issues. This study includes participants who are experiencing problems with their lungs such&#xD;
      as breathing difficulties, shortness of breath, and/or reduced exercise tolerance. The&#xD;
      intervention is a twice weekly singing and breathing retraining intervention conducted over&#xD;
      ten weeks. A range of self-report questionnaire measures will evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      intervention in addressing these problems. Focus groups and individual interviews will also&#xD;
      be used to gather information on the impact and acceptability of the programme.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Covid-19 Yorkshire Rehab Screen (C19YRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The C19YRS was developed as a screening tool to monitor long-term symptoms due to Covid-19. The screening tool covers 19 items which combines yes/no answers and an 11 point ordinal scale (0-10) where a higher score denotes increased symptom severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DePaul Symptom Questionnaire - Short Form DSQ - SF</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The DPSQ -SF assesses key symptoms of ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome such as fatigue, post-exertional malaise, sleep, pain, neurological/cognitive impairments and autonomic, neuroendocrine and immune symptoms. At each item, participants have to rate the frequency and severity of the symptom on a scale from 0 to 4. A higher score denotes increased symptom severity.</description>

    <description>This arm of the project explores Singing as an intervention for people suffering from Pulmonary Fibrosis specifically.&#xD;
It is a 10 week programme. All other aspects of the intervention are the same in terms of delivery and length of classes.&#xD;
Different outcome measures, namely the St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire is used in this trial. This is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in patients with airways disease. Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating more limitations.</description>

    <intervention_name>SingStrong: Strong lungs through Song</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants who have been clinically diagnosed with Covid-19 and who continue to suffer residual adverse effects on the lung health will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
The intervention will involve biweekly hour-long breathing and singing classes that are designed to correct dis-ordered breathing, and retrain the principal muscles of respiration.&#xD;
Pre and post evaluation of participant bio-psychosocial health and wellness will be conducted. Triangulation of data using focus groups and individual interviews will be conducted after conclusion of the intervention,</description>
