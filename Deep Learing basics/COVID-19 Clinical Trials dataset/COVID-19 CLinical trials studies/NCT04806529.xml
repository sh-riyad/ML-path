  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of aCoV2 versus a placebo to&#xD;
      prevent the first occurrence of virologically-confirmed symptomatic COVID 19 according to the&#xD;
      European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) COVID 19 case definition. The&#xD;
      co-primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of aCoV2 versus a placebo to&#xD;
      prevent virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID 19 defined by the US Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) guidance.&#xD;
