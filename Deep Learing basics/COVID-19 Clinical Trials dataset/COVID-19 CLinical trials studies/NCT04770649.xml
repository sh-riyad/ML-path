  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VOICES is a longitudinal, prospective, observational study that will enroll up to 10,000&#xD;
      subjects of diverse racial backgrounds being administered an emergency use authorized&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine, for collection and analysis of stool and blood samples. It has recently&#xD;
      been shown that the gut microbiome, the collection of microbes that line our GI tract, play a&#xD;
      significant role in vaccine immune response and severe complications from COVID-19. The&#xD;
      identification of biomarkers may aid in predicting response to vaccination and are critical&#xD;
      towards improving vaccine-induced immunity. These real-world patient derived biomarkers could&#xD;
      be used as interventional targets for the design of innovative adjuvant co-therapies that can&#xD;
      boost an effective immune response to the vaccine, enhancing efficacy for a broader&#xD;
      population, including those at most risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the entry criteria will provide two samples each of blood, one prior to and&#xD;
      one following vaccine administration. Follow-up questionnaires will be sent at 3, 6, 9, and&#xD;
      12 months to determine if participants have contracted COVID-19 or have experienced any&#xD;
      adverse effects of the vaccine. Nasal swab samples will also be collected from participants&#xD;
      that have contracted COVID-19. The samples will be analyzed to determine the impact of gut&#xD;
      microbiome composition and function on the immune system and vaccine efficacy.&#xD;

        It is anticipated that 10,000 subjects will be enrolled in this study. It is preferred that&#xD;
        enrollment is balanced by sex; however, it is not required. All efforts will be made to&#xD;
        provide racial/ethnic balance, with a goal of 50% underrepresented minorities.&#xD;
