    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the process experienced by physiotherapists while&#xD;
      providing rehabilitation services during the epidemic and to investigate the procedures&#xD;
      adopted by physiotherapists who are currently working. In addition, by analyzing the effects&#xD;
      of both the pandemic and the clinical and educational organizations in the Physiotherapy and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Clinics where physiotherapists were working during the COVID-19 epidemic, the&#xD;
      needs arising after the pandemic can be reported. Assessments will be carried out by&#xD;
      researcher physiotherapists through a questionnaire based on research and examples in the&#xD;
      literature, and scales measuring anxiety, depression and stress levels. The measurement tool&#xD;
      will be the online survey application.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the process experienced by physiotherapists while&#xD;
      providing rehabilitation services during the epidemic and to investigate the procedures&#xD;
      adopted by physiotherapists who are currently working.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, by analyzing the effects of both the pandemic and the clinical and educational&#xD;
      organizations in the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Clinics where physiotherapists were&#xD;
      working during the COVID-19 epidemic, the needs arising after the pandemic can be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be carried out by researcher physiotherapists through a questionnaire based&#xD;
      on research and examples in the literature, and scales measuring anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      stress levels. The measurement tool will be the online survey application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is planned to take place in February-March 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys will be distributed via WhatsApp, e-mail, social media links. This questionnaire was&#xD;
      sent to 3 physiotherapists and subjected to a pre-test. This questionnaire is about the&#xD;
      following situations and contains 37 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on employment status: In this section, physiotherapists' name-surname, gender,&#xD;
      age, professional practice experience (years), generally applied physiotherapy subgroup (more&#xD;
      than one can be selected), whether they are self-employed or employees, and the status of&#xD;
      performing face-to-face clinical practices will be questioned. If so, it will be questioned&#xD;
      which protection measures have been applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about tele-rehabilitation practices: In this section, it will be questioned&#xD;
      whether physiotherapists start to follow their patients remotely, if they are, in what way&#xD;
      they do it, whether the number of weekly sessions continues, and whether the amount collected&#xD;
      is the same as the face-to-face amount.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General information about COVID 19 rehabilitation: In this section, did the departments where&#xD;
      physiotherapists work returned to COVID 19 services, did they work in COVID 19 units,&#xD;
      rehabilitation approaches in COVID 19 patients, protocol and / or guidelines on exercises for&#xD;
      rehabilitation management and treatment of COVID 19 patients. material development /&#xD;
      implementation status will be questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact of the pandemic on the health and teaching activities of physiotherapists and the&#xD;
      sustainability of clinical / thesis studies during this period will be questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the CES Depression Scale (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, CES-D)&#xD;
      will be used to determine depression level, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) Test&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate generalized anxiety level, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) will be used&#xD;
      to determine stress level.&#xD;

    <time_frame>The evaluation will take place in one interview (the interview will take 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale will be used to determine depression level. The scale consists of 20 questions in the form of a self-report that measure the emotional state of the person in depression, perceptions and behaviors towards depression. 4-point Likert type questionnaire with 0-60 points range is encoded in 0-3 points range.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of anxiety level with Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 Test</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation will take place in one interview (the interview will take 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 test will be used to determine anxiety level. It is a 7-item four-point Likert (0 = none, 1 = many days, 2 = more than half of the days, 3 = almost every day), which evaluates the experiences asked in the scale items in the last 2 weeks. The total scores obtained from the scale are 5, 10, and 15 cut-off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of stress level with Perceived Stress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The evaluation will take place in one interview (the interview will take 30 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived Stress Scale will be used to determine stress level. Participants rate how often their lives were seen as unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overly intense during the previous month on the 5-point Likert scale (0 = Never, 4 = Very often). Total scores range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating a higher perceived stress level.</description>
