      This study is an open-label, single-center, randomized phase IV clinical trial of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (Vero cell) manufactured by Sinovac Research &amp; Development&#xD;
      Co., Ltd. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      concomitant administration of the SARS-CoV-2 Inactivated Vaccine (Vero cell) with&#xD;
      Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine in adults aged from 18 to 59 Years. 480 healthy adults as&#xD;
      participants are randomly assigned into two groups in the ratio 1:1. The first group was the&#xD;
      combined immunization group, which is randomly divided into two subgroups, 120 subjects in&#xD;
      each group. The combined immunization subgroup Ⅰ receive SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      &amp;Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine on day 0 and SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (second dose) on&#xD;
      day 28.The combined immunization subgroup Ⅱ receive SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine on day 0&#xD;
      and SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine (second dose) &amp; Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine on day 28.&#xD;
      The second group was the non combined immunization group，which receive SARS-CoV-2 inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine (first dose) on day 0, Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine on day 14 and SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      inactivated vaccine (second dose) on day 28.&#xD;
