  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label controlled household-randomised trial designed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of RESP301 alongside standard of care (&quot;SOC&quot;) versus SOC alone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we are investigating RESP301 as a post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESP301 is a liquid which is inhaled using a handheld nebuliser and produces Nitric Oxide,&#xD;
      which is also naturally produced in the human body and is a key part of our defence against&#xD;
      infections in the lungs. In a laboratory setting,RESP301 has been shown to be highly&#xD;
      effective against many respiratory viruses, including CoV2 and influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESP301 is currently being used as treatment for hospitalised COVID-19 patients in an ongoing&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this PEP study is to prevent onward transmission of the infection within&#xD;
      households by treating both the infected individual and their household members. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is to evaluate the incidence of newly confirmed CoV2 infection (PCR positive) in&#xD;
      previously uninfected household members (PCR negative, antibody negative and unvaccinated) of&#xD;
      CoV-2 positive index cases after a 7 day course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who are not eligible to participate, or do not want to participate will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in an optional study where they will be asked to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be on the study for a total duration of 15-17 days. Approximately 600&#xD;
      adults will be on the study in total and index cases will be randomised 1:1 to either RESP301&#xD;
      (plus SOC) or SOC alone, with all eligible persons in the same household enrolled into the&#xD;
      same treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into the following periods: Baseline Visit / screening (1 day):&#xD;
      Treatment Period (self administered at home - 7 days): End of Treatment Period (1 day):&#xD;
      Follow-Up Period (~5-7 days): Follow-Up Call (1 day between day 15-17)&#xD;
