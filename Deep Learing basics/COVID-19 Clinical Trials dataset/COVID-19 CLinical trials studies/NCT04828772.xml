      The purpose of this study is to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of&#xD;
      participants who are hospitalized due to coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), treatment use for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and COVID-19 symptoms, and composite outcomes of COVID-19. This study will also&#xD;
      compare composite outcomes between COVID-19 participants treated with and without&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy during follow-up period.&#xD;
