      Telemedicine &quot;healing at a distance&quot; Telemedicine has many advantages especially in time of&#xD;
      pandemics for both doctors and patients, low cost and easily accessibility. Pandemics&#xD;
      especially COVID 19 has radically change the medical team thoughts about the telemedicine. It&#xD;
      can decrease the exposure of the medical team to infection and expected by some of the&#xD;
      medical team to be very beneficial if done in good and legal manner. Although, telemedicine&#xD;
      has many advantages, also has many disadvantages and medicolegal problems, breakdown in the&#xD;
      relationship between medical teams and patients, mis diagnosis or wrong treatment. There are&#xD;
      many legal and ethical aspects of telemedicine. These include the medical responsibilities,&#xD;
      the confidentiality and privacy of the patients can not be maintained, the jurisdictional&#xD;
      problems. Shortage of medical practitioners and specialists, shortage of internet facilities,&#xD;
      low education levels in some patients all are problems facing the telemedicine in developing&#xD;
      countries. The evolution of telemedicine poses a series of legal problems ranging from the&#xD;
      profiles on the subject of authorization and accreditation to those concerning the protection&#xD;
      of patient confidentiality, the definition and solution of which, in the absence of specific&#xD;
      regulatory provisions, is mainly left to the assessment of compatibility of the practices&#xD;
      adopted so far, with the general regulatory framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be done to clarify the role of telemedicine, and if it has a share hand or&#xD;
      the upper hand if compared with traditional medicine.&#xD;
