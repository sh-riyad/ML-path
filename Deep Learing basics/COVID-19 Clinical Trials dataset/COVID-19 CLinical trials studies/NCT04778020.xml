    <textblock>
      PURPOSE. The main objective of the present study is to carefully characterize the clinical&#xD;
      profile of individuals with lasting sequelae after a COVID-19 admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, the analysis of the risk-adjusted influence of COVID-19 severity,&#xD;
      previous comorbidities and management of patients discharged after COVID-19 will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Cross-sectional and prospective registry, a real life &quot;all&#xD;
      comers&quot; type, with voluntary participation, without specific funding or conflicts of&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a study initiated by researcher that will have advanced statistical support from the&#xD;
      IMAS foundation (Institute for the Improvement of Health Care, Madrid, Spain) and the&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Research Foundation (FIC, Madrid, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      International level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS PROTOCOL. The study has been approved by Hospital Clinico San Carlos Ethic´s&#xD;
      Committee (21/128-E) and the institutional board of each participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study proposes the continuation in time of the work previously carried out in the&#xD;
      HOPE registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It proposes to select all the patients attended in any health center (with in hospital beds),&#xD;
      who have been discharged or have died up to 31st august 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All will be considered eligible with a positive COVID-19 test (any type) or if their&#xD;
      attending physicians consider them highly likely to have presented the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the anonymous characteristics of the registry and the health alarm situation generated&#xD;
      by the virus, in principle, it is not considered necessary to provide written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;

        Same inclusion/exclusion as HOPE COVID-19. We propose the long-term follow-up of patients&#xD;
        discharged after a COVID-19 admission up to 31st august 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consecutive inclusion and the completion of patients previously included in HOPE registry&#xD;
        is strongly warranted.&#xD;
