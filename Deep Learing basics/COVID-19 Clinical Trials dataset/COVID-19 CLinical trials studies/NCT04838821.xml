  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive immunotherapy is a therapeutic alternative used in a variety of infectious diseases&#xD;
      including COVID-19. Equine polyclonal hyperimmune sera is a source of neutralizing antibodies&#xD;
      against SARS-CoV-2 and a therapeutic alternative under investigation in COVID-19 patients. In&#xD;
      the previous study NCT04610502 no significant variations were observed regarding efficacy and&#xD;
      safety between two different pharmaceutical preparations of equine hyperimmune sera and&#xD;
      adequate tolerability was reported with both investigational products. Formulations were&#xD;
      produced through repeated immunization with viral recombinant proteins and contain either&#xD;
      antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein (S type) or a combination of viral proteins that&#xD;
      included S1, N (nuclear), E (envelop) and M (membrane) (M type). Another investigation&#xD;
      (NCT04494984) found that the administration of a pharmaceutical preparation similar to the S&#xD;
      type produced clinical improvement in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia,&#xD;
      particularly those with severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of an anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      hyperimmune equine serum formulation (S-type) as an addition to the standard therapeutic&#xD;
      approach in adult hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of moderate or severe COVID-19,&#xD;
      radiological findings consistent with pneumonia and a symptom onset period not exceeding 10&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 156 patients will be included and randomly divided into four groups, each group&#xD;
      will receive a different dose of the investigational drug. On day 1, all participants will&#xD;
      receive a single intravenous infusion containing the specified dose according to their&#xD;
      assigned group. Clinical assessments, laboratory determinations that include: viral load,&#xD;
      antibodies quantification, inflammatory and coagulation markers, cytokines levels as well as&#xD;
      standard evaluations will be performed for each patient. Data will be collected for all&#xD;
      groups on Days 0 to 7, 14 and 28 or at discharge after completion of treatment. The study&#xD;
      will end for each participant on the day of discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
