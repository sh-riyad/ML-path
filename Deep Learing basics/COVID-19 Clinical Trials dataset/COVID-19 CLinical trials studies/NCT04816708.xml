  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized waitlist control trial assessing if the feasibility of using a&#xD;
      mobile mindfulness app to treat emotional distress and burnout amongst nurses taking care of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. This trial will tell us if we can disseminate the intervention to a large&#xD;
      number of nurses in a short time period, and if the intervention has evidence of a clinical&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emotional distress and burnout are common among health care workers, particularly among&#xD;
      nurses. These burdens have been worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic's imposition of&#xD;
      substantial physical and psychological stressors as well as persistent worry about personal&#xD;
      health. There are few effective therapies for healthcare workers' symptoms of distress, fewer&#xD;
      still that can be easily scaled, and most require face-to-face contact which is discouraged&#xD;
      during a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness is a type of mind-body therapy that promotes a practice of non-judgmental&#xD;
      awareness that can alleviate distress by uncoupling emotional reactions and habitual behavior&#xD;
      from unpleasant symptoms, thoughts, and emotions. LIFT is a mobile mindfulness app which can&#xD;
      assess levels of emotional distress via survey, and subsequently offer mindfulness content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the unmet needs of frontline nurses, we propose the LIFT-Healthcare Worker pilot&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT). We will explore the feasibility and impact of the LIFT mobile&#xD;
      app in relieving symptoms of emotional distress among nurses directly caring for COVID-19&#xD;
      patients in the Duke University Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to enroll up to 200 participants. After signing consent, participants will be&#xD;
      randomized via the LIFT app in a 2:1 (intervention:control) fashion into two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Arm 1: Intervention group (access to LIFT mindfulness app)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Arm 2: Control waitlist group (delayed access to LIFT app)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1, which is to determine the feasibility of using the LIFT app among nurses directly&#xD;
      caring for COVID-19 patients, will be assessed via the app which tracks user fidelity and&#xD;
      adherence, and the use of an interactive dashboard for administrative users (i.e., study&#xD;
      team) to track individual participant use. An open ended narrative question at 1 month will&#xD;
      also help provide guidance for improving usability in future studies, as will directed&#xD;
      telephone interviews with participants with high and low app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2, which is to assess evidence of clinical impact of LIFT compared to control among&#xD;
      nurses directly caring for COVID-19 patients at 1 month, will be assessed by comparing&#xD;
      changes in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder -7 (GAD-7)&#xD;
      questionnaire, the Maslach Burnout Index (MBI), and Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4) over the&#xD;
      study duration (1 month) between intervention and usual care groups.&#xD;
