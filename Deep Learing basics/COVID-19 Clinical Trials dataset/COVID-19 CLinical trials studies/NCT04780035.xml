      The objective of the clinical study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and prophylactic efficacy of the EpiVacCorona vaccine in volunteers aged 18 and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study tasks are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the safety of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice intramuscularly;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the tolerability of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify any adverse events to the administration of the EpiVacCorona vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate the humoral immune response following two doses of the EpiVacCorona vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  investigate the cell-mediated immune response following two doses of the EpiVacCorona&#xD;
           vaccine;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the prophylactic efficacy of the EpiVacCorona vaccine when administered twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will screen a maximum of 4,929 volunteers of both sexes aged 18 and above, of which&#xD;
      3,000 volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have the exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2,250 volunteers who will be vaccinated with the EpiVacCorona vaccine, twice&#xD;
           intramuscularly at a dose of 0.5 ml;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  750 volunteers who will be vaccinated with a placebo, twice intramuscularly at a dose of&#xD;
           0.5 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If volunteers drop out of the study, they will not be replaced. All volunteers will be&#xD;
      followed up by an investigator physician for 6 months following the first vaccination in&#xD;
      order to identify possible late adverse events. In case the volunteer has any late reactions,&#xD;
      he/she will be invited to the clinic to correct his/her condition.&#xD;
