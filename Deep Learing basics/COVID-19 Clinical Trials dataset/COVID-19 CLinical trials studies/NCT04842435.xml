      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard&#xD;
      therapy for the treatment of patients with a moderate COVID-19 form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises two stages, 1 and 2 Stage 1 tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine and compare the safety parameters of COVID-globulin after a single infusion&#xD;
           at doses of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo in addition to standard therapy in the&#xD;
           treatment of patients with COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine and compare the efficacy parameters of COVID-globulin after a single&#xD;
           infusion at doses of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo in addition to standard&#xD;
           therapy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine the optimal therapeutic dose of COVID-globulin for the treatment of&#xD;
           patients with moderate COVID-19 by comparing the safety and efficacy parameters of doses&#xD;
           of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to study the pharmacokinetic parameters of COVID-globulin in the blood plasma of&#xD;
           patients after a single infusion at a dose of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg, in addition to&#xD;
           standard therapy for the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to study the efficacy of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard therapy, for the&#xD;
           treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to study the safety of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard therapy, for the&#xD;
           treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to conduct a comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of a group of patients with&#xD;
           moderate COVID-19 disease who receive COVID-globulin in addition to the standard&#xD;
           therapy, and a group of patients who receive placebo in addition to standard therapy.&#xD;
