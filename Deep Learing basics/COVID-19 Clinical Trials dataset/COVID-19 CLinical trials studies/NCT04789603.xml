  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the pandemic caused by SARC-CoV 2, more than 81 million cases have&#xD;
      been diagnosed and caused around 1,7 million deaths. Currently, a drug is being sought for&#xD;
      the treatment of coronavirus. The worldwide effort to create an effective and safe COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine is beginning to yield results. Several vaccines now have been authorized around the&#xD;
      globe; many more remain in development. Nonetheless, in the absence of effective&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment and given the virus's transmission capacity, different alternatives&#xD;
      have been proposed to stop the transmission of the virus. Therefore, these preventive&#xD;
      measures against transmission are expected to remain in force for some time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transmission of the virus occurs from person-to-person; different studies conclude that&#xD;
      transmission occurs by aerosols from respiratory droplets. The optimal distance between&#xD;
      people to stop person-to-person transmission is uncertain. For this reason and given that&#xD;
      there is no effective drug, transmission prevention is of great importance especially for&#xD;
      pandemic mitigation in community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The World Health Organization (WHO) established simple precautions to prevent the spread of&#xD;
      the virus such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated,&#xD;
      avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. For this&#xD;
      reason, the use of the mask has been proposed in several countries, being mandatory in many&#xD;
      of them, for use in the health environment and daily use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WHO recommends different types of masks depending on the person, where it will be used,&#xD;
      or the population incidence in the area. Wearing a medical /surgical mask is recommended for&#xD;
      people over 60, those who have underlying medical conditions, feel unwell, and/or look after&#xD;
      an ill family member. For health workers, respirator masks (such as FFP2, FFP3, N95, N99)&#xD;
      should be used in settings where procedures are generating aerosols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a mask could imply an inspiratory and expiratory restraint and generate a feeling&#xD;
      of discomfort in many people. It is responsible for an increase in the inspiratory and&#xD;
      expiratory pressures generated. This feeling of discomfort and the increment of pressures&#xD;
      causes shallow and forced breathing and increases the respiratory accessory musculature&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Person et al. observed that the subjects who used a mask felt dyspnea clinically and&#xD;
      significantly higher than those who did not use it. However, to our knowledge, no study has&#xD;
      analyzed the parameters of physical effort, respiratory parameters, self-perceived dyspnea,&#xD;
      and muscle activation using different types of masks in healthy subjects. For this reason,&#xD;
      the present study hypothesis is that there are no changes between wearing and not-wearing a&#xD;
      mask (surgical or N-95) in the effort and ventilatory parameters, even though there may be an&#xD;
      increase in the tone of the cervical muscles or the perception of dyspnea using a face mask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to observe the effect that the surgical mask and the N-95 mask have in the&#xD;
      distance walked, in the oxygenometry, in the heart rate, in the sensation of dyspnea, and the&#xD;
      tone of the inspiratory accessory muscles during the 6 minutes walking test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure After verifying that the subjects meet the inclusion criteria and sign the consent,&#xD;
      they will be given a registration number. An investigator will observe the number in a random&#xD;
      list and included the participant in one of the three groups (without a mask, with a surgical&#xD;
      mask, and with N95 mask). This researcher will make an initial registration of demographic&#xD;
      data (gender, age, weight, height, cardiorespiratory pathology, smoker, number of cigarettes&#xD;
      per day, a sport performed, hours of daily sport, and days of sport per week). Before the&#xD;
      test, all the subjects will have to remain for 30 minutes without a mask, breathing normally.&#xD;
      This phase will be called the resting phase. Subsequently, the subjects will go to the area&#xD;
      where the 6MWT will be carried out. Each one of them will be performed the test according to&#xD;
      the group to which they will be assigned. An investigator, blinded to the subsequent&#xD;
      assessment, will encourage the participants to take the 6MWT according to the recommendations&#xD;
      mentioned above. After performing the 6MWT, all subjects will go to the assessment area. All&#xD;
      the subjects will wear a surgical mask so that the researcher can not know to which group&#xD;
      they have been assigned. Besides, this researcher will not have access to the registration&#xD;
      number or the 6-minute walking test area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each resting phase, SpO2 and baseline HR will be recorded. After every 6MWT,&#xD;
      the HR, SpO2, and self-perceived dyspnea will be recorded. The muscle tone will also be&#xD;
      assessed with the MyotonPRO in middle scalene and SCM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have the option of retaking the test, going through all the phases mentioned&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
