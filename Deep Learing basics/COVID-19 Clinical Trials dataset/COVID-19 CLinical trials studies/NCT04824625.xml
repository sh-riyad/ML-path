  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      From the beginning of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, most events with massive&#xD;
      participants have been canceled due to being considered high-risk events for the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      transmission. It has been detected that asymptomatic people infected by SARS-CoV-2, are&#xD;
      playing an important role in the contagious in these kinds of events. The economic losses&#xD;
      arising from the closure of these activities, mainly those related to culture and musical&#xD;
      performances are around 2.5 billion euros a Catalonia, and a considerable loss of jobs in&#xD;
      this sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing strategies of cribrate of infected people by SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic or not&#xD;
      diagnosticated and with a potential transmission of the virus is the key to perform cultural,&#xD;
      sport, etc. massive events with all the security. The objective is to exclude infected people&#xD;
      with a a high potential of transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is needed to use versatile tests for this objective, so the test must have a high&#xD;
      sensibility to detect infected people, the test has to be easy to manipulate without&#xD;
      requiring a high technology of the laboratory hospitals, neither prolongated to obtain a&#xD;
      result and that has a low cost. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen screening tests are best suited&#xD;
      for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 27th March, a musical concert will be performed at Palau St Jordi (Barcelona) with 5000&#xD;
      attendees and with all the SARS-COV-2 safety measures by the &quot;Secretary General of Health of&#xD;
      the Generalitat de Catalunya&quot; a (mandatory wearing a mask during the event, restricted&#xD;
      outdoor areas of bar and smoking enhanced ventilation of the whole indoor area and avoiding&#xD;
      queues.). This study wants to assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to the&#xD;
      health system among the attendees of this commercial concert during the 14 days following the&#xD;
      event, also it will be evaluated the clinical evolution of the possible infections during the&#xD;
      concert.&#xD;

      for this purpose. These tests have shown a sensitivity close to 99% to detect infectious&#xD;
      people who have a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2. No viral isolation has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      any culture of samples of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with a Ct threshold (cycle&#xD;
      threshold) in the test RT-PCR greater than 30, which is considered to delimit the&#xD;
      transmitting potential of the infected&#xD;
&#xD;
      On 27th March, a musical concert will be performed at Palau St Jordi (Barcelona) with 5000&#xD;
      attendees and with all the SARS-COV-2 safety measures by the Secretaria General de Salut de&#xD;
