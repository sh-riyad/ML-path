      This is a study prospective cohort study at an urban academic centre, with two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Health outcomes, and maternally transferred antibodies, in babies born to mothers who&#xD;
           had antenatal COVID-19 and convalesced before delivery, followed up until 12 months of&#xD;
           age&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety and protective properties of breast milk after lactating women are vaccinated&#xD;
           against COVID-19&#xD;

      This proposal aims to provide a multi-faceted approach to study how immunity may be&#xD;
      transferred - both transplacentally and through breastfeeding, from mother to child, in the&#xD;
      context of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We first recruit all babies delivered to mothers convalescent from antenatal COVID-19, to 1)&#xD;
      follow up their growth and development, and 2) study the protective effects of antibodies&#xD;
      transferred from mother to child transplacentally during pregnancy, as well as postnatally&#xD;
      through breastfeeding. We compare these to a cohort of healthy controls whose mothers did not&#xD;
      have COVID-19 during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, we compare the protective effects of antibodies transferred during breastfeeding from&#xD;
      mother to child after lactating mothers are vaccinated against COVID-19, to that of natural&#xD;
      infection. We also study the safety of breastfeeding after vaccination by looking for vaccine&#xD;
      components in the breast milk.&#xD;
