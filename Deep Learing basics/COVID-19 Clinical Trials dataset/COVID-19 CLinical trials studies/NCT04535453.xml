  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess humoral immune responses of 3 dose levels of&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered intramuscularly (IM) as a 2-dose schedule (56 days apart);&#xD;
      Ad26.COV2.S administered IM as a single vaccination in adults (18-65 years or older) and to&#xD;
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S, administered IM as 2-dose or 1-dose&#xD;
      schedule in adolescents (12-17 years) and to test both compressed and expanded 2-dose&#xD;
      schedules of Ad26.COV2.S (28 and 84 days apart) in adults (18-65 years or older).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program is to develop a safe and&#xD;
      effective vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. Currently, there is only limited&#xD;
      availability of authorized/licensed vaccines for the prevention of coronavirus disease-2019&#xD;
      (COVID-19). Ad26.COV2.S (also known as Ad26COVS1) is a monovalent vaccine composed of a&#xD;
      recombinant, replication incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode&#xD;
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spike (S) protein,&#xD;
      which will be assessed in this study. Also, different vaccination intervals and multiple&#xD;
      lower dose levels compared to the dose levels in the first in human (FIH) study&#xD;
      (VAC31518COV1001 [NCT04436276]) will be assessed. For adults, the study consists of:&#xD;
      screening phase (28 days), vaccination phase (1-3 months) depending on the vaccination&#xD;
      interval, and follow-up (12 months) and for adolescents, the study will consist of a&#xD;
      screening phase (28 days), a vaccination phase (2 months), a booster vaccination 12 months&#xD;
      after the first vaccination, and a follow-up phase (12 months after the booster vaccination).&#xD;
      The study duration is approximately 15 months (Groups 1-5 and Group 7 [for participants for&#xD;
      whom vaccination 2 was delayed]), 14 months (Group 7 [for participants for whom vaccination 2&#xD;
      was not delayed]), 16 months (Group 9), 20 months (Group 6), 19 months (Group 8) and 27&#xD;
      months (Group 10) in adult groups and approximately 25 months for adolescents group (Groups A&#xD;
      to F). The adverse events and other safety assessments including vital signs measurements&#xD;
      (heart rate, supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body&#xD;
      temperature) and physical examinations will be assessed during the study.&#xD;
