      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and&#xD;
      azithromycin (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase IIB study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and&#xD;
      azithromycin (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive active or placebo study treatment. The target&#xD;
      sample size was 2000 participants, with approximately 1000 in each arm. Stratification was by&#xD;
      &quot;high&quot; versus &quot;low&quot; risk of progression to severe COVID-19, where &quot;high risk&quot; was defined as&#xD;
      a person age ≥60 years or having at least one of several specified comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were prescribed study treatment for 7 days and were to be followed for an&#xD;
      additional 24 weeks. Assessments on a subset of participants were planned to include blood&#xD;
      collection, self-collected nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On June 23, 2020, sites were informed that the study was closing to follow-up due to slow&#xD;
      enrollment and lack of community enthusiasm. Follow-up through week 24 was not completed for&#xD;
      any participant. Participants were asked to complete the Day 20 visit and then were&#xD;
      discontinued from the study. Due to the early termination, enrollment into the specimen&#xD;
      collection subset did not occur, and results associated with those specimens are not&#xD;
      available. Due to the small number of participants enrolled, some statistical tests were not&#xD;
      able to be performed and only descriptive results are provided.&#xD;

    <description>Hospitalization was defined as requiring at least 24 hours of acute care in a hospital or similar acute care facility, including Emergency Rooms or temporary facilities instituted to address needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation at a hospital or similar facility with less than 24 hours of acute care was not considered a hospitalization. Formal statistical testing was not conducted due to the small number of participants and events.</description>

    <description>Hospitalization was defined as requiring at least 24 hours of acute care in a hospital or similar acute care facility, including Emergency Rooms or temporary facilities instituted to address needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation at a hospital or similar facility with less than 24 hours of acute care was not considered a hospitalization.

    <measure>Duration of Fever</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 20, 21 days total</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time from study treatment initiation to the last day in the participant's daily diary card on which a temperature greater than 100.4°F was recorded or a potentially antipyretic drug, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, was taken. Participants with at least one temperature who never reported fever or use of anti-pyretic medications were assigned a duration of zero days</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Symptoms Associated With COVID-19 Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 20, 21 days total</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the time from start of study treatment to the last day in the participant's daily diary card on which a moderate or worse targeted symptom was recorded. The set of target symptoms were cough, shortness of breath, feeling feverish, fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, headache, sore throat, nasal obstruction (stuffy nose), nasal discharge (runny nose), loss of smell, and loss of taste. Participants who had missing diary records due to hospitalization were assumed to have moderate symptoms during the period of hospitalization in the analysis. Missing diary card records not due to hospitalization were assumed to have absent symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant-specific Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Symptom Score Associated With COVID-19 Disease Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 20, 21 days total</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the sum of scores for the targeted symptoms (defined in the protocol) in the participant's daily diary record (each symptom was scored from 0-best to 3-worst). Participant-specific areas under the curve (AUC) over time were calculated using the trapezoidal rule and defined as the area below the line formed by joining total symptom scores on each daily diary card from the pre-treatment score on Day 0 through to Day 20. AUCs were rescaled by time by dividing by 21 (corresponding to the number of daily diary cards during follow-up between pre-treatment Day 0 and Day 20), in order to provide results on a symptom scale from 0-best to 42-worst (for non-hospitalized participants). Participants who were hospitalized were assigned a value equal to the sum of the maximum possible scaled AUC (42) and the duration of hospitalization, and thus values &gt;42 were possible. Missing scores between pre-treatment and Day 20 were linearly interpolated. Higher AUCs indicate worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Time to Self-reported Return to Usual (Pre-COVID) Health.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 20, 21 days total</time_frame>
    <description>Time to self-reported return to (pre-COVID) usual health was defined as the time from the start of study treatment to the first day in the participant's daily diary card on which they responded 'Yes' with no subsequent reports of 'No' to the question &quot;Have you returned to your usual (pre-COVID) health today?&quot; Participants who never reported a 'Yes' response were assigned a duration of 22 days.</description>

        <title>Participant-specific Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Symptom Score Associated With COVID-19 Disease Over Time</title>
        <description>Defined as the sum of scores for the targeted symptoms (defined in the protocol) in the participant's daily diary record (each symptom was scored from 0-best to 3-worst). Participant-specific areas under the curve (AUC) over time were calculated using the trapezoidal rule and defined as the area below the line formed by joining total symptom scores on each daily diary card from the pre-treatment score on Day 0 through to Day 20. AUCs were rescaled by time by dividing by 21 (corresponding to the number of daily diary cards during follow-up between pre-treatment Day 0 and Day 20), in order to provide results on a symptom scale from 0-best to 42-worst (for non-hospitalized participants). Participants who were hospitalized were assigned a value equal to the sum of the maximum possible scaled AUC (42) and the duration of hospitalization, and thus values &gt;42 were possible. Missing scores between pre-treatment and Day 20 were linearly interpolated. Higher AUCs indicate worse outcomes.</description>
