    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a virus newly identified in January 2020. The WHO defined COVID-19 as&#xD;
      a health emergency of international importance. The clinical manifestation of the COVID-19&#xD;
      disease cannot be fully described in the short time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First insights in patients suffering from acute kidney injury (AKI) during COVID-19 indicate&#xD;
      severe course with high mortality. The locally varying spread of SARS CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      requires a better understanding of clinical course of COVID-19 in order to be able to&#xD;
      establish future treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination of attributable mortality and costs of COVID-19 will need to be studied on a&#xD;
      multinational basis and therefore Kidney in COVID-19 Registry will particularly use a matched&#xD;
      case control design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a virus newly identified in January 2020 in Wuhan, China, which&#xD;
      belongs to the group of coronaviruses and causes COVID-19. Due to the rapid spread worldwide,&#xD;
      high morbidity and virulence the of causing SARS-CoV-2 , the WHO defined COVID-19 as a health&#xD;
      emergency of international importance in February 2020. Due to the rapid spread of the new&#xD;
      virus, a comprehensive understanding of the transmission, the course of the disease, the&#xD;
      diagnosis and the therapeutic regimen is of the utmost importance. Initial case reports&#xD;
      indicate that human-to-human transmission takes place through droplet infection. In contrast&#xD;
      to previously known infections from the group of coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a&#xD;
      high ability to infect with already mild symptoms resulting in frequent outbreak situation of&#xD;
      worldwide importance. Furthermore, high viral loads are found in the upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      of infected people leading to the high virulence of causing SARS-CoV-2. The clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of the COVID-19 disease cannot be fully described in the short time. However,&#xD;
      symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection are described with mild symptoms like fever, muscle&#xD;
      pain, and dry cough as well as severe complications like virus pneumonia, Acute Respiratory&#xD;
      Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Interestingly older and chronically ill patients in&#xD;
      particular have a severe course of COVID-19 with intensive care treatment and high mortality.&#xD;
      At present, there is no specific therapy available for COVID-19. Treatment approaches are&#xD;
      primarily supportive with admission of patients to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and maintenance of fluid and&#xD;
      electrolyte balance. Patients with severe renal insufficiency and fluid retention, pulmonary&#xD;
      edema or hyperkalemia may require dialysis. First insights in patients suffering from acute&#xD;
      kidney injury (AKI) during COVID-19 indicate severe course with high mortality. First case&#xD;
      reports do not describe a beneficial effect of antiviral therapy. The locally varying spread&#xD;
      of SARS CoV-2 infection requires a better understanding of clinical course of COVID-19 in&#xD;
      order to be able to establish future treatment approaches. Investigators have to attach great&#xD;
      importance to high-risk cohorts like patients suffering from chronic renal disease with many&#xD;
      comorbidities or patients after kidney transplantation under immunosuppressive drug&#xD;
      treatment. Although COVID-19 has been studied for only a few month it is known that&#xD;
      especially these patients develop a severe clinical course. Due to increasingly frequent&#xD;
      outbreak situations and globally chances in species distributions, local, as well as&#xD;
      worldwide surveillances in epidemiology and species distribution are urgently needed. As the&#xD;
      clinical course of COVID-19 disease is dependent on the causing viral pathogen and the full&#xD;
      picture of clinical manifestation is not yet understand further studies with regard to the&#xD;
      disease course are mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the examination of attributable mortality and costs of COVID-19 will need to be&#xD;
      studied on a multinational basis and therefore Kidney in COVID-19 Registry will particularly&#xD;
      use a matched case control design.&#xD;
