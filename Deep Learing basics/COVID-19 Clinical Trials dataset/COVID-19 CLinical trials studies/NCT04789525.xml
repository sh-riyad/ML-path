  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is observed that children affected with COVID-19 who are physically inactive or in a&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle may induce and develop childhood obesity (CO). the management of this&#xD;
      clinical condition has received very little attention, there is no well-defined exercise&#xD;
      protocols or dietary prescription for this special population; therefore, it needs an&#xD;
      elaborative trial in this field, so the aim of his study was to find the clinical and&#xD;
      biochemical effects of high-intensity aerobic training with a high protein diet in childhood&#xD;
      obesity following COVID-19 infection&#xD;

    <description>High-intensity aerobic training was given with 50 to 70 % of the maximum heart rate. the intervention started with 10 mins of warm-up exercise through stretching of upper and lower limb muscles. Subsequent to stretching, the subjects were asked to do 30 mins of exercises; consisting of 20 mins on the treadmill and 10 mins of cycle ergometer at 50 to 70 % of MHR, then with 10 mins of cool down.</description>
