      the surgical wards through the emergency department at the Jordan University Hospital in the&#xD;
      periods from March 2020 to May 2020. The records were compared to those of the patients who&#xD;
      were admitted in the same period from the year 2019.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection includes the number of admissions, the reason for admission, the average of&#xD;
      symptoms duration until admission, the age of the patients admitted, gender, type of&#xD;
      management, and the average length of stay before discharging the patients.&#xD;
