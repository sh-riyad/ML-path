      The purpose of this study is to assess SARS CoV-2 infection, viral shedding, and subsequent&#xD;
      potential transmission in university students immunized with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection, as well as its effect on peak nasal viral load as a measure of infection and a&#xD;
      proxy of infectiousness, in university students aged 18-26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine by injection at Months 0 and 1; participants in Group 2 will&#xD;
      receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine by injection at Months 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study visits for Group 1 will occur at Months 2 and 4; for Group 2, at Months 0&#xD;
      and 2. Study visits may include medical history, vaccine injections, blood collection, nasal&#xD;
      swab, SARS-CoV-2 screening, COVID-19 symptom check, and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the main study participants, the study will also evaluate infectiousness&#xD;
      following close contacts with main study participants. Study procedures for close contacts&#xD;
      include questionnaires and blood samples; for those who become SARS-CoV-2 infected, study&#xD;
      procedures will also include nasal swabs.&#xD;
