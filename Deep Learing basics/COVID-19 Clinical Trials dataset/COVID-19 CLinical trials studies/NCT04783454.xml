  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of a general training program and&#xD;
      educational session to prevent neck and/or low back pain in desktop workers&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all subjects that met the preset&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and gave written informed consent to participate will be randomized into&#xD;
      an intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio. Next, subjects of both groups will undergo&#xD;
      baseline testing (online survey). The subjects of the intervention group receive a single&#xD;
      educational video (online) and are motivated to follow 2 training sessions of 60 minutes&#xD;
      each, during 12 consecutive weeks. Instructions for the specific exercises are provided via&#xD;
      an online platform. The subjects of the control group are instructed to maintain their normal&#xD;
      working activities and activities of daily life and receive no further intervention. Subjects&#xD;
      of both groups are prompted to fill out a weekly online logbook to gather information on&#xD;
      their physical activity and neck and/or back complaints. All subjects undergo&#xD;
      post-intervention testing at 12 weeks (short term effects), 6 months, and 12 months (long&#xD;
      term effects).&#xD;
