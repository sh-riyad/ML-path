      This study is aiming to find the relation between the severity of COVID-19 in diabetic and&#xD;
      obese patients and the high serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7),matrix&#xD;
      metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), TGF-β and PDGF Macrophage Activation Markers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) commonly occurs in COVID-19 patients who are&#xD;
      diabetic and obese, ARDS is characterized by inflammation and pulmonary fibrosis mediated by&#xD;
      cytokines and biomarkers released from activated alveolar macrophages, also cytokine storm&#xD;
      may occurs leading to multiple organ failure. These sequelae of COVID-19 disease in obese and&#xD;
      diabetic patients are attributed to elevated plasma lipopolysaccharide which is the main&#xD;
      activator of M1 and M2 macrophages. chronic activation of macrophages leads to production of&#xD;
      profibrotic markers as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      (PDGF), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) which promote&#xD;
      fibrogenesis. In this research, we measure circulatory alveolar macrophage activation markers&#xD;
      in COVID-19 obese patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
