  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A stratified, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of remotely delivered&#xD;
      START treatment to individuals with severe-to-moderate stroke (with recruitment focused on&#xD;
      individuals with low SES) will be conducted. Subjects and assessors will be blinded to the&#xD;
      condition making the experiment double blind. Specifically, subjects will be told that we are&#xD;
      exploring a new therapy that using different sounds to improve therapy. Parallel group design&#xD;
      will ensure that subjects in the Control group are unaware that their &quot;sounds&quot; are softer&#xD;
      than the START group. Trainers may become aware that a loud sound is present thus a unique&#xD;
      Assessor will evaluate clinical performance before and after training making the study&#xD;
      double-blind. Fifty-four subjects will undergo baseline testing in the laboratory to&#xD;
      establish their capacity for functional and expressive speech as well as their self-reported&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (power analysis below). Next, subjects will participate in a&#xD;
      high-frequency, word-picture verification/ auditory-repetition treatment, 2 hr/day for 5&#xD;
      consecutive days focusing on expression of words of functional significance (e.g., water,&#xD;
      fall). Subjects will either receive training with START or without (Control). Subjects will&#xD;
      be re-tested immediately following training as well as one-month post to assess retention.&#xD;
      Aim 1 will evaluate capacity of START to enhance SLT outcomes by assessing the % change in&#xD;
      clinical assessment of functional and expressive speech. Our preliminary data points to a&#xD;
      robust response [details]. Aim 2 will focus on the capacity of these changes to 1) be&#xD;
      retained and 2) impact subject's reported quality of life. NOTE: While we are planning&#xD;
      in-person baseline, end, and retention testing, in response to COVID, we have established&#xD;
      remote clinical screening using peer-reviewed validated techniques for WAB and ABA-2 (see&#xD;
      Alternative Solutions). All preliminary data collected for this proposal were collected&#xD;
      remotely via no-contact protocols.&#xD;

             personnel trained by an audiologist in a sound-attenuated booth. Based on our ongoing&#xD;
