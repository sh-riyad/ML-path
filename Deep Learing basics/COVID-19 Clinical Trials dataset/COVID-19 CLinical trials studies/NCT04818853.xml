  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the number of individuals with severe CoVID who&#xD;
      require ventilator support and who develop serious fungal infections. The study is an&#xD;
      observational study, meaning that we are not providing any intervention that does not involve&#xD;
      usual standard of care. Our chief goal is to find evidence of fungal infection by using&#xD;
      traditional, approved methods of diagnosis, but by applying these methods in the same way and&#xD;
      frequency among all study participants. We will be looking especially for evidence of a&#xD;
      fungal infection known as Aspergillus, which can causes a serious lung infection called&#xD;
      invasive aspergillosis (IA).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a disease caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-COV2 which emerged&#xD;
      in late 2019 in Wuhan, China (1). This illness is associated with viral prodromal symptoms,&#xD;
      then subsequently fever, cough, and shortness of breath (1). In a subset of patients, lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection associated with respiratory failure develops. Among these&#xD;
      patients, progression to severe respiratory failure and ARDS requiring ventilator support has&#xD;
      occurred in an alarming number of patients at rates that are many-fold higher than what is&#xD;
      typically associated with seasonal influenza A or B (2). One of the most feared complications&#xD;
      of post-influenza respiratory failure is the development of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis&#xD;
      which may occur in as many as 15-20% of those requiring ventilator support (based on European&#xD;
      data) (3-6). Among those developing IA following influenza A or B, mortality of 50% or&#xD;
      greater is reported (3-6).&#xD;

      Discarded clinical samples from routine testing will be collected and tested for diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes on a weekly basis. These will include serum, deep suction specimens, and BAL when&#xD;
      available. These samples will be tested for Aspergillus GM, Aspergillus PCR, and Pneumocystis&#xD;
      PCR. Specimens will be stored at the CDC biorepository for future diagnostic use.&#xD;
