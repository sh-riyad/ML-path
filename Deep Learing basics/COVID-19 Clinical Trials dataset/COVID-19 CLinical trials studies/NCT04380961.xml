  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical response of sirukumab (administered as&#xD;
      a single intravenous dose) plus standard of care (SOC) compared to placebo plus SOC in&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (RNA) betacoronavirus. Symptoms of COVID-19 infection may appear from 2 to&#xD;
      14 days following exposure, with the spectrum of illnesses ranging from mild symptoms to&#xD;
      severe illness or death. The identification of SARS-CoV-2 follows the emergence of 2 other&#xD;
      novel betacoronaviruses: SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      (MERS-CoV). Current management of COVID-19 is supportive, and respiratory failure from acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the leading cause of mortality. While an&#xD;
      understanding of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is still evolving during&#xD;
      the ongoing pandemic, the current knowledge of the disease burden highlights the urgent&#xD;
      medical need to develop a treatment. Sirukumab (also known as CNTO136) is a human&#xD;
      anti-interleukin (IL)-6 immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1k) monoclonal antibody (mAb). Sirukumab&#xD;
      binds with high affinity and specificity to human IL-6 and as a result inhibits IL-6-mediated&#xD;
      signaling and the biological effects of IL-6. The study will include a Screening Phase (up to&#xD;
      1 Day), a Treatment Phase (Day 1 to Day 28) and a Follow-up Phase (post Day 28, follow-up&#xD;
      phone calls on Week 8, Week 12 and Week 16). Safety evaluations will include monitoring of&#xD;
      adverse events and serious adverse events, physical examinations, vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy testing, and checking of vital&#xD;
      status. The entire study duration for each participant will be 16 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Time to improvement is defined as an improvement of at least 2 categories relative to baseline on the 6-point ordinal clinical recovery scale.
