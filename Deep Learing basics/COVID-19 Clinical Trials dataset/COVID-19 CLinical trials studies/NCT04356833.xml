  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some patients infected with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and develop patients a severe&#xD;
      form of a lung disease called respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In these patients, the&#xD;
      lungs become severely inflamed because of the virus. The inflammation causes fluid from&#xD;
      nearby blood vessels to leak into the tiny air sacs in the lungs, making breathing&#xD;
      increasingly difficult. This fluid forms small clots in the air sacs, creating a barrier&#xD;
      until the cells regenerate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some patients, this clot does not disappear in a timely fashion or interferes with the&#xD;
      development of the new cells. Furthermore, the small clots in the air sacs obstruct the air&#xD;
      and oxygen getting deep into the lungs, interfering with proper ventilation. The trial will&#xD;
      recruit patients with COVID-19 induced ARDS. Eligible patients (or if patients lack capacity,&#xD;
      their legal representative) will be provided with an information sheet and informed consent&#xD;
      will be sought. Eligibility will be mainly assessed via routine clinical assessments.&#xD;
      Patients will receive a nebulised version of a type of drug called tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator (rt-PA) that is inhaled using a nebuliser. This is normally a drug used to break&#xD;
      down blood clots. In this situation though, it might be useful for stopping clots forming in&#xD;
      the lungs, because these might lead to even more difficulties with breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run two cohorts sequentially. In cohort 1, 9 consented patients received&#xD;
      nebulised rtPA in addition to SOC. 6 patients were receiving IMV and 3 were receiving non&#xD;
      invasive support with NIV or CPAP or high flow oxygen or standard oxygen therapy. As an&#xD;
      observational arm, matched historical controls who received standard of care were also&#xD;
      recruited at a ratio of 2 controls to every 1 treatment arm patient, resulting in 18&#xD;
      historical controls. Originally, the study aimed to recruit 12 patients with 6 on each&#xD;
      ventilation type (IMV and non-invasive oxygen support). This would have resulted in 24&#xD;
      historical controls. After the first wave of COVID-19 cases decreased in August 2020 in the&#xD;
      UK it became difficult to continue recruitment, so recruitment closed for cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a second surge underway in early 2021, cohort 2 will aim to recruit more patients during&#xD;
      this period to provide more data on the safety of rtPA. Fewer timepoints will be collected,&#xD;
      which will allow for more rapid recruitment while at the same time not compromising safety&#xD;
      monitoring. A more flexible dosing regimen for rtPA will be utilised. 30 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in total, with an aim to recruit a minimum of 10 IMV patients and 10 patients on&#xD;
      non-invasive oxygen support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate efficacy, the improvement of oxygen levels over time and safety will be be&#xD;
      monitored throughout. Blood samples will be taken to measure markers of clotting and&#xD;
      inflammation in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the end of the treatment phase both groups will be followed up in accordance with SOC&#xD;
      for 28 days from the day of first dose of rtPA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label, single centre, uncontrolled, repeated dose, pilot trial of&#xD;
      nebulised rt-PA in patients with COVID-19 ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients requiring either IMV or NIV. Eligible patients (or if&#xD;
      patients lack capacity, their legal representative) will be provided with an information&#xD;
      sheet and informed consent will be sought. Eligibility will be assessed via routine clinical&#xD;
      assessments, which may have been done prior to consent. The only exceptions are a pregnancy&#xD;
      test (blood or urine), and possibly any assessments that were not done as per routine care.&#xD;
      These must be done following consent, and all screening assessments must have been done&#xD;
      during the 24-hour period before dosing with rt-PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 12 consented patients will receive nebulised rt-PA in addition to SOC. As an&#xD;
      observational arm, matched historical controls who received standard of care were also&#xD;
      recruited at a ratio of 2 controls to every 1 treatment arm patient, to ensure that any&#xD;
      changes are not entirely due to disease resolution. In the treatment group, 6 patients will&#xD;
      be receiving IMV and another six will be receiving NIV. This consituted cohort 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in the rt-PA group, 10 mg of rt-PA dissolved in 5 ml of diluent will be given&#xD;
      every 6 hrs for 3 days (this was extended to 14 days with a subsequent amendment). Dose&#xD;
      modifications will not be permitted. Efficacy will be assessed by the monitoring of arterial&#xD;
      oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a second surge underway in early 2021, cohort 2 will aim to recruit more patients during&#xD;
      this period to provide more data on the safety of rtPA. Fewer timepoints will be collected,&#xD;
      which will allow for more rapid recruitment while at the same time not compromising safety&#xD;
      monitoring. A more flexible dosing regimen for rtPA will be utilised. Patients on IMV will&#xD;
      receive 60mg daily over three doses for 14 days, NIV patients will receive 60mg daily for&#xD;
      over 3 doses for two days, followed by 12 days receiving 40mg daily over two doses. 30&#xD;
      patients will be recruited to cohort 2 in total, with an aim to recruit a minimum of 10 IMV&#xD;
      patients and 10 patients on non-invasive oxygen support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring will be performed by assessment of the incidence and severity of bleeding&#xD;
      events, and by the monitoring of plasma fibrinogen levels and routine coagulation parameters.&#xD;
      Additional samples will be taken for exploratory assessment of potential biomarkers,&#xD;
      including (but not restricted to) PAI- 1, alpha 2 antiplasmin and a range of inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and coagulation proteins. All other monitoring will be done as per SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the end of the treatment phase (after Day 14) patients will be followed up in accordance&#xD;
      with SOC for 28 days from the day of first dose of rtPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically powered randomised controlled trial (RCT) would be ideal to define the&#xD;
      magnitude of benefit and impact on overall survival and is the typical design in patients&#xD;
      with ARDS. Although there is clinical data on the safety of nebulised rt-PA, but there is no&#xD;
      clinical data in this clinical condition to facilitate a sample size calculation. There is&#xD;
      data from a small RCT that has used another fibrinolytic agent, but the doses are not&#xD;
      comparable. When a patient is randomised to receive no treatment, this precludes&#xD;
      participation in other interventional studies which might decrease the risk of mortality. The&#xD;
      most recent figures suggest a 50% mortality in patients receiving IMV there is 50% mortality.&#xD;
      Currently there is a concerted effort to introduce multiple therapies based on our&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiologic basis of disorder. Further, if this pilot study shows&#xD;
      significant effect in a subset of patients, there would be justification to progress to a&#xD;
      statistically powered RCT. In the event of major adverse drug reactions or minor improvement&#xD;
      in the oxygenation as assessed by PaO2/FiO2 , there are minimal gains to be had with a larger&#xD;
      randomised control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is extensive experience with the use of nebulised rt-PA in the context of the&#xD;
      underlying inflammation, safety measures been included. A gap of 24hrs will be maintained&#xD;
      between first and second patient. At 24hrs if patient 1 has no evidence of major pulmonary&#xD;
      bleeding suggesting exaggerated alveolar fibrinolysis and no evidence of fibrinogen reduction&#xD;
      of more than 50%, suggestive of systemic absorption a second patient will be dosed. Both&#xD;
      patients will be evaluated for 72 hrs for major pulmonary bleeding and if no bleeding is&#xD;
      noticed than the rest of the cohort can be recruited after the review of the safety data by&#xD;
      the trial management group comprised of the investigators. If there are any concerns with the&#xD;
      data this will be referred to the DMC for review. If the safety profile is acceptable, dosing&#xD;
      of the third and subsequent patients in the rt-PA group will resume with no required interval&#xD;
      between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be described as a relative improvement in PaO2/FiO2 (or SaO2/FiO2) ratio&#xD;
      assessed at day 5 and day 7 after start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be set-up to review safety data within the trial along&#xD;
      with the final study results and advise on progressing from a pilot study to a randomised&#xD;
      control trial based on the safety and efficacy data that is collected. The DMC will receive&#xD;
      weekly reports on bleeding complications, both major and minor along with fibrinogen levels.&#xD;
      If at any time a patient has major pulmonary bleeding, further dosing of patients will be&#xD;
      stopped and an adhoc DMC review will be arranged before resuming dosing (see section 12.2&#xD;
      Data Monitoring Committee).&#xD;
