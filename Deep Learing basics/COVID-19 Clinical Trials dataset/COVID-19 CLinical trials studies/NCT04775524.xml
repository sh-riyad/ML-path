  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the feasibility and effectiveness of an online version of&#xD;
      the Storytelling Through Music (STM) program with oncology nurses who have worked during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study employs a two-group, randomized controlled trial design that will utilize&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the feasibility and intervention effect of&#xD;
      an alternative delivery (online) of the Storytelling Through Music program (STM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study of In-person delivery of Storytelling Through Music program STM with oncology&#xD;
      nurses found it to be feasible and beneficial to coping with stress and work-related&#xD;
      emotions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include: screening for eligibility and study intervention&#xD;
      including follow-up surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into two (2) groups: Storytelling Through Music (STM) and&#xD;
      Waitlist (Storytelling Through Music-Hybrid)&#xD;
&#xD;
      STM group: Participants are led through a writing workshop over an online platform (i.e.,&#xD;
      Zoom or an equivalent) to develop their story. Simultaneous with the writing sessions are&#xD;
      10-minute self-care lessons. At the end of the development workshop, each participant will be&#xD;
      paired with a songwriter who will turn participant stories into songs. A final workshop will&#xD;
      be held for participants to debrief about the emotional experience of participating in the&#xD;
      Storytelling Through Music program (STM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waitlist control group (Storytelling Through Music-Hybrid), will listen to songs created by&#xD;
      healthcare workers in the Storytelling Through Music program (STM) for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation length will be based on the randomized group assignment, a total of 19 weeks&#xD;
      for the STM group and 13 weeks for the waitlist group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
