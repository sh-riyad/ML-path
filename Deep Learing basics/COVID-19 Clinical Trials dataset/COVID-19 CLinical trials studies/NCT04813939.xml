  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is prospective, observational study using point of care test to determine bio-ADM whole&#xD;
      blood concentrations and its predictive value in patients with COVID-19 treated in the ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 5% of all patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus require treatment in the ICU. The&#xD;
      main reason for admission to the ICU is acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, which in most&#xD;
      cases is associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. The progression of lung damage&#xD;
      affects not only alveoli but also endothelium of the pulmonary vessels. Occurring&#xD;
      endotheliopathy is caused by direct infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and activation of the&#xD;
      immune system leading to an increased inflammatory reaction. Damage to the endothelium&#xD;
      barrier with concomitant cytokine storm lead to activation of the coagulation system and&#xD;
      formation of microthrombotic events in the vascular bed, resulting in thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications and development of multiorgan failure. The reflection of the above&#xD;
      pathophysiological phenomena in laboratory tests is a significant increase in the&#xD;
      concentration of D-dimers. At present, no specific markers of endotheliopathy in patients&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 are known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adrenomedullin (ADM) is a peptide hormone that plays a key role in regulating the function of&#xD;
      the endothelium, by modulating its integrity and permeability, it also has an effect on the&#xD;
      vascular muscle, leading to vasodilation. Recently, the role of ADM has been intensively&#xD;
      studied, including in sepsis. Several studies have confirmed an association between elevated&#xD;
      ADM levels and poor prognosis in sepsis and septic shock. In these studies, measurements of&#xD;
      various adrenomedullin precursors and free, biologically active adrenomedullin&#xD;
      (bio-adrenomedullin, bio-ADM) were performed. The role of bio-ADM in the course of COVID -19&#xD;
      remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the baseline concentration of bio-ADM and to determine&#xD;
      the dynamic of the concentration changes in three measurements in patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      during ICU treatment. Additional measurement of bio-ADM will be performed as standard&#xD;
      monitoring in patients suspected of septic complications of the course of COVID-19.&#xD;

    <description>Point of care assessment of bio-adrenomedullin concentration will be performed using the IB10 sphingotest® bio-ADM® apparatus (Sphingotec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) on the 1,3,5-day ICU stay in COVID-19 patients. The method used is a double monoclonal sandwich immunoassay to measure the concentration of C-terminal amidated, biologically active adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) in whole blood. Additional measurement of bio-ADM will be performed as standard monitoring in patients suspected of septic complications of the course of COVID-19.</description>
