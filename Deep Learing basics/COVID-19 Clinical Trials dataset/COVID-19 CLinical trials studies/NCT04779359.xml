  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the predictive role of lymphocyte subsets and other laboratory measurements in&#xD;
      adult patients with COVID-19.This was a single center, retrospective study that involved&#xD;
      adult patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Electronic medical records were&#xD;
      reviewed. Data including age, sex, symptom from onset to hospital admission and laboratory&#xD;
      findings at admission of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 were extracted and&#xD;
      analyzed retrospectively.This study indicates that the levels of lymphocyte subsets (CD4+,&#xD;
      and CD8+) are associated with disease progression and severity, along with prognosis in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

      This was a single center, retrospective study that involved adult patients with confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of COVID-19. Electronic medical records were reviewed. Data including age, sex,&#xD;
      symptom from onset to hospital admission and laboratory findings at admission of hospitalized&#xD;
      patients with confirmed COVID-19 were extracted and analyzed retrospectively. Identifying the&#xD;
      possible immune factors and laboratory parameters is requisite for the early identification&#xD;
      of patients with severe COVID-19 and timely intervention for control of the disease. There is&#xD;
      an unmet need to establish robust clinical cutoffs of lymphocyte subsets for predicting risk&#xD;
      associated with ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      This retrospective study was thus carried out to improve knowledge and clinical utility of&#xD;
      lymphocyte subset measurements, together with other laboratory measurements and clinical&#xD;
      information, for understanding prognosis in COVID-19 patients. These findings suggest that&#xD;
      alterations in lymphocyte subsets and laboratory measurements play a significant role in the&#xD;
      progression of COVID-19.&#xD;

    <description>The study endpoints were to demonstrate whether CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts are prognostic marker in determining disease outcomes (including ICU admission and/or mechanical ventilation and/or mortality); to explore whether lymphocyte subset measurements recover at hospital discharge or in convalescence; lymphocyte subset measurements between severe and non-severe groups, at admission. In addition, association between CD4+ and CD8+ T cell absolute counts with cytokine levels and other laboratory parameters (neutrophil counts, total lymphocyte counts, platelet counts, C-reactive protein levels) were also assessed.</description>
