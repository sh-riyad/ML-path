  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the feasibility and limited efficacy of a Virtual Reality (VR)&#xD;
      intervention to alleviate symptoms of perceived breathlessness and dyspnea in individuals&#xD;
      recovering from severe COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Refractory breathlessness is the experience of breathlessness that persists despite optimal&#xD;
      treatment of the underlying pathophysiology, and results in physical, psychosocial disability&#xD;
      for the patient. As observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients, a significant portion of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients present with persistent respiratory physiological impairment and refractory&#xD;
      breathlessness that may not be addressed with conventional respiratory treatment such as&#xD;
      oxygen, bronchodilators, diuretics or non-invasive ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research on respiration-related feedback in Virtual Reality (VR) has demonstrated&#xD;
      strong and replicable effects of VR feedback over one's perceived sense of agency and control&#xD;
      over one's virtually embodied respiration. Based on these studies, the VR intervention&#xD;
      evaluated here aims to alleviate symptoms of perceived breathlessness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This within-subject study will compare breathing (dis-) comfort prior, during, and after a VR&#xD;
      intervention that provides embodied visual feedback of participants' on-going respiration.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes include subjective reports from participants (perceived efficacy,&#xD;
      acceptability, and demand) and the intervention's clinical feasibility. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include changes in respiration rate and variability as well as subjective ratings on&#xD;
      perceived embodiment and sense of agency.&#xD;

    <measure>Respiratory Rate</measure>

    <measure>Respiratory Rate Variability</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one year</time_frame>
    <description>Change in respiratory rate variability depending on VR intervention. Respiratory rate variability (RRV) is measured using inter-breath intervals (IBI).&#xD;
RRV will be assessed with respect to baseline recordings.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of one year</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective ratings depending on VR intervention. Questionnaire items are on a 7 point Likert scale. Agreement indicates stronger embodiment. Two control items are included that are not expected to change between conditions.</description>

    <intervention_name>COVVR</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants wear a respiration belt (Vernier, Go Direct) that continuously transmits thoracic circumference readings to a mobile phone (Samsung Galaxy S8) in real-time. The mobile device is placed in a headset (Zeiss VR ONEPLUS) and used to create a stereoscopic, immersive scene in Virtual Reality. The data from the respiration belt is used to map the on-going respiration pattern onto a virtual body in the scene in one of two feedback conditions: 1) synchronous: participants receive real-time feedback of their respiration, 2) asynchronous: participants receive asynchronous, frequency modulated feedback of their respiration.</description>
