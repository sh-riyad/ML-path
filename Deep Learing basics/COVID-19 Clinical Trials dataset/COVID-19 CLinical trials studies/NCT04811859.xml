  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 infection, which is considered as a pandemic by the World Health Organization,&#xD;
      affects the whole world. COVID-19 is an infectious respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
      It is stated in early studies that after COVID-19 infection, there are adverse effects on&#xD;
      both the peripheral and respiratory muscles along with the pulmonary system involvement. The&#xD;
      purpose of our study; To examine the effect of Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) on&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, respiratory functions and functional capacity in PostCOVID-19&#xD;
      patients. Patients who have been hospitalized and discharged with the diagnosis of COVID-19&#xD;
      in Istinye University hospitals, at least 6 weeks have passed since the infection, the PCR&#xD;
      test has turned negative will be taken. The evaluation and treatment of the patients will be&#xD;
      carried out in the Education and Research Units of Istinye University Physiotherapy and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation Department. Patients included in the study will be randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups, study and control groups. Demographic evaluation form, Post Covid Functional Status&#xD;
      Scale, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) Dyspnea scale,&#xD;
      Corbin posture analysis, Respiratory function test, Respiratory muscle strength measurement,&#xD;
      Respiratory Muscle Endurance measurement, 6-minute walking test (6 MWT) ), Peripheral Muscle&#xD;
      Strength, Grip Strength, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Breathlessness&#xD;
      Perception Questionnaire (BBQ) and Nottingham Health Profile Questionnaire will be used. In&#xD;
      the study group, IMT will be applied at 40% of the maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) for&#xD;
      eight weeks, every day of the week, twice a day for 15 minutes. The patients will come for a&#xD;
      control once a week, the MIP values will be measured again and the new training intensity&#xD;
      will be determined at 40% of the new MIP value. The control group will be given a constant&#xD;
      training of 15 minutes at 10% of the MIP, twice a day, every day of the week for eight weeks.&#xD;
      Evaluations of the study and control groups will be made at the beginning and after eight&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Pulmonary Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary Function Test will be performed using a portable spirometry according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) will be expressed as the percentages of the predicted values.</description>

    <measure>Inspiratory muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory muscle strength are the static inspiratory pressure measured at the mouth. It is called maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and it will be assessed using an electronic pressure transducer. The MIP will be measured at residual volume.</description>

    <description>Inspiratory Muscle Training is a form of resistance (weight) training which strengthens the muscles that you use to breathe. When these muscles are strengthened regularly for a period of a few weeks they adapt, becoming stronger and being able to work for longer.</description>
