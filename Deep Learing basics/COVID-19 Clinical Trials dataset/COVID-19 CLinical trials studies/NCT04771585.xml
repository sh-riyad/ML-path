  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the aerosols emitted during various respiratory activities will be quantified&#xD;
      in healthy subjects. The differences in aerosol size spectrum and number during tidal&#xD;
      breathing, speaking, coughing and singing will be assessed. Subjects with an endogenously&#xD;
      high aerosol emission will repeat the respiratory activities wearing face masks with varying&#xD;
      particle filter capacity to investigate the aerosol emission reduction.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Able and willing to give written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Healthy male and female subjects, aged 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body mass index between 18 and 35 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. FEV1 â‰¥ 80% predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination or lung function at&#xD;
             screening visit, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject&#xD;
             at risk because of participation in the study or may influence the results of the&#xD;
             study, or the subject's ability to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Risk of non-compliance with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and&#xD;
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of an acute respiratory infection with symptoms such as cough, rhinitis, sore&#xD;
             throat, hoarseness or fever, within four weeks prior to the informed consent visit. In&#xD;
             case of acute respiratory infection during study participation, the visit may be&#xD;
             rescheduled within the allowed time window. Subjects must be asymptomatic for at least&#xD;
             3 days. Re-screening is allowed should the time window be exceeded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of lung disease including but not confined to COPD, asthma or pulmonary&#xD;
             fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of latex allergy.&#xD;
