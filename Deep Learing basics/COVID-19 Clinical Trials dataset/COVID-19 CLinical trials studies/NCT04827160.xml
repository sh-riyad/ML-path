  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high incidence of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) has been demonstrated in COVID-19.&#xD;
      This incidence correlates with disease severity. Activation of coagulation secondary to&#xD;
      sepsis combined with classical thrombotic risk factors may contribute to this prothrombotic&#xD;
      state. Since the beginning of March 2020, the issue of venous thrombosis during SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection has rapidly emerged as a major medical challenge since a significant rate of&#xD;
      patients were thrombosing, some of them in spite of a well conducted preventive&#xD;
      anticoagulation. Although D-dimers have been shown to be useful in identifying patients at&#xD;
      risk of severe COVID-19 and even mortality, they cannot be used for diagnostic exclusion of&#xD;
      pulmonary embolism. Indeed, since D-dimer levels rise non-specifically during infectious&#xD;
      states, the exclusion threshold of 500 ng/ml cannot be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would therefore be useful to study the predictive value of D-dimers for thrombosis in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;

      Primary outcome : Characterize different D-dimer trends in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the predictive value of different D-dimers trends for thrombosis / all-cause&#xD;
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the predictive value of D-dimers at admission for thrombosis / all-cause&#xD;
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the predictive value of 1st D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio for thrombosis / all-cause&#xD;
           mortality / orotracheal intubation during hospitalization&#xD;
