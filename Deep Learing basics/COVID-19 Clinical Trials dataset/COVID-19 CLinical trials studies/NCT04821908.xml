  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-CoV2 pandemic, which emerged in the first quarter of 2020, has led to an&#xD;
      unprecedented health crisis in our modern healthcare systems and has resulted in strong&#xD;
      national public health measures. The impact of the pandemic and its indirect environmental&#xD;
      consequences on pediatric asthma is currently being assessed. In particular, the study of its&#xD;
      role on the risk of exacerbations and modification of control is one of the priority research&#xD;
      objectives defined by European societies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to study the impact of the pandemic on asthma control in children aged&#xD;
      3-16 years with a medical diagnosis of asthma, compared to data from other observational&#xD;
      cohorts conducted in the same region prior to the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub-population of children 3-16 years will be assessed at exacerbation and at a follow-up&#xD;
      visit, 2-4 months later, with clinical data, biological and microbiological samples.&#xD;

      Children aged 3-16 years with a medical diagnosis of asthma, will be assessed for asthma&#xD;
      control, exacerbation rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be compared to data from other observational cohorts conducted in the same region&#xD;
      prior to the pandemic.&#xD;
