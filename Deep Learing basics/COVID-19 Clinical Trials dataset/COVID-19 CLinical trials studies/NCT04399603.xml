  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United Kingdom, there are currently 138,000 confirmed patients with coronavirus,&#xD;
      causing 18,738 deaths. Whilst the disease may be mild in the majority of patients, a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients require intensive care therapy and a ventilator due to&#xD;
      lung injury. In addition to lung injury/failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)),&#xD;
      around 50% of patients admitted to intensive care develop acute kidney injury (AKI)&#xD;
      (requiring advanced support via haemofiltration) and multi-organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is unclear why patients suffering from COVID-19 develop such severe lung injury (requiring&#xD;
      life support or ventilation) or indeed why patients develop other organ dysfunction such as&#xD;
      kidney injury. The investigators hypothesis that this may due to an over-reaction of the&#xD;
      immune system particularly in the lungs. This then results in the release of various&#xD;
      mediators and biological messengers which can be pushed into the blood bloodstream&#xD;
      (exacerbated by positive pressure generated by the ventilator). These mediators then travel,&#xD;
      via the blood, to other organs such as the kidney where they cause inflammation and injury of&#xD;
      cells, resulting in organ failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to apply their well-established laboratory methods to further&#xD;
      the scientific community's knowledge of this severe and deadly viral condition and we hope&#xD;
      that this would lead to the development of medication that would treat this deadly virus.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 is a highly contagious virus, causing a global health emergency. A significant&#xD;
      number (~17%) of hospitalised patients become severely unwell and require admission to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) due to lung failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS))&#xD;
      and multi-organ failure (MOF). Sadly, 51.8% of COVID-ARDS patients develop kidney failure,&#xD;
      which has a markedly increased risk of dying (61%). We have learned that kidney failure&#xD;
      starts several days after lung failure, which suggest an initial viral &quot;attack&quot; on the lungs&#xD;
      followed by kidney involvement several days later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines are &quot;signalling&quot; molecules made by cells, which in healthy individuals help fight&#xD;
      disease. It was initially thought that in COVID-19, lung cells release excessive cytokines&#xD;
      (i.e. cytokine storm), which then cause kidney injury and MOF. However, research has&#xD;
      demonstrated that cytokine levels in blood are actually very low and not enough to explain&#xD;
      the extent of organ injury in COVID-19. This perhaps explains why treatment strategies aimed&#xD;
      at specifically damping down the action of these particular cytokines in COVID-19 have&#xD;
      failed. Consequently, there remains no cure for COVID-19 MOF, and whilst treatments such as&#xD;
      steroids, manage symptoms, have a general anti-inflammatory effect and improve mortality, 30%&#xD;
      of intensive care patients still die. Therefore, urgent research is needed to improve&#xD;
      scientific knowledge of this condition and identify new therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvesicles (MVs) are extremely small particles released by cells and carry various&#xD;
      chemicals including cytokines, from inside the cell, packaged securely and safely within&#xD;
      membranes (cellular envelopes). These vesicles act as 'postmen' delivering chemical&#xD;
      messengers (e.g. cytokines) between cells and are important in various diseases where&#xD;
      inflammation is implicated. We have demonstrated that MVs have a fundamental role in the&#xD;
      development of organ failure in our laboratory models of non-COVID ARDS but we do not yet&#xD;
      know the role of these vesicles in the development of ARDS/MOF in COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that during COVID-19 infection of the lung, significant numbers&#xD;
      of MVs are released within the lung (especially in severe COVID-19), which then &quot;transmit&quot;&#xD;
      signals and inflammation to other organs via the bloodstream, causing organs to fail.&#xD;
      Furthermore, as chemical messengers (e.g. cytokines) are hidden inside these vesicles, they&#xD;
      are not measured by standard laboratory techniques and may explain why there are low cytokine&#xD;
      levels in blood. This may also clarify why treatments inhibiting circulating cytokines (not&#xD;
      hidden in vesicle membranes) have failed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore these ideas, the group aim to investigate MVs in blood and urine of ICU patients&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19 (20mls blood (1 1/3 tablespoons); 10ml urine (3/4 tablespoon)). The&#xD;
      investigators intend to examine which chemicals are present in these tiny vesicles and to&#xD;
      relate this information to the clinical progress or otherwise of patients. These data will&#xD;
      help the scientific community understand the chemical systems involved in severe COVID-19,&#xD;
      tell us the significance of MVs and whether blocking MV signalling could lead to new&#xD;
      treatments for COVID-19. Furthermore, analysis of these MVs may allow the investigators to&#xD;
      identify patients who are likely to become seriously ill, which would help in planning&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
