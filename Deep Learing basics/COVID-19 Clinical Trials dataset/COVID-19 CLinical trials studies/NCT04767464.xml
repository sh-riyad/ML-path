  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Compass Course (CC) is a group intervention designed for individuals with Breast Cancer.&#xD;
      Over the course of 8 face-to-face group sessions, the CC is designed to help participants&#xD;
      reclaim a sense of self-grounded purpose in daily life, defined as intentional use of time&#xD;
      and energy in ways that align with one's values, strengths, and sources of personal meaning&#xD;
      (e.g., inner compass) in the moments that compose a day. Because of COVID-19, in-person&#xD;
      groups are discouraged and so we need to identify new ways to provide group-based&#xD;
      interventions that are feasible and efficacious.&#xD;
