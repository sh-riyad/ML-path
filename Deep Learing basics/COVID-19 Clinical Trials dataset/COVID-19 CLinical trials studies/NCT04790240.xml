  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human immune system is designed to protect individuals from external sources of infection&#xD;
      and internal cell mutation. It works effectively and efficiently until inflammation disturbs&#xD;
      its functioning. Once compromised by inflammation, the immune system loses its capacity to&#xD;
      recognize antigens and dependably defend the body against disease and illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When COVID-19 invades humans, it causes an immune-storm (cytokine-storm) that can directly&#xD;
      damage the organ(s), leading to death. The virus is an antigen - a trigger - but it is not&#xD;
      the actual reason that causes organ failure and death; instead, it is the body's over immune&#xD;
      reaction that is the cause. In attempting to protect the body, the immune system overreacts&#xD;
      to the antigen, which includes the infected cells, which causes a cytokine-storm, and the&#xD;
      subsequent and rapid shut down of the infected individual's organ(s)' structure, leaving the&#xD;
      body without sufficient strength or time to fight back. When the medical herbs join the body,&#xD;
      it can slow down the immune reaction. Medical herbs benefit the physical body; they protect&#xD;
      the cells and organism structure and mediate the immune response, allowing the T cells to&#xD;
      kill the virus (mutated or not) internally. Such success has been achieved by the All Natural&#xD;
      Medicine Clinic during pre-clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study's goal is to demonstrate that the immune system can be rebuilt and&#xD;
      retrained, using natural medicine (i.e., medical herbs), to kill the virus without causing&#xD;
      the immune storm, and to explore the mechanism by which these medical herbs, which have been&#xD;
      used for thousands of years for healing, achieve results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to CDC data, as of January 30, 2021, 25,780,144 individuals residing in the United&#xD;
      States had been infected by COVID-19 and 435,151 had died as a result of the disease. No drug&#xD;
      has yet been identified that explicitly kills the COVID-19 virus. While various vaccines have&#xD;
      been developed to prevent infection, the virus continues to mutate, and scientific research&#xD;
      remains behind the virus trajectory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The human immune system, when functioning properly, can prevent the body from succumbing to&#xD;
      infections from external sources and from internal cell mutations, including the COVID-19&#xD;
      virus and cancer cells. That is, the defense system comes from nature. This clinical study&#xD;
      proves that the immune system can respond to those antigens and kill them if the immune&#xD;
      system is given a chance. However, the human immune system can become compromised through&#xD;
      inflammation and subsequently unable to successfully prevent infection and cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When COVID-19 invades humans, it causes an immune-storm (cytokine-storm) that can directly&#xD;
      damage the organ(s), leading to death. The virus is an antigen - a trigger - but it is not&#xD;
      the actual reason that causes organ failure and death; instead, it is the body's over-immune&#xD;
      reaction that is the cause. In attempting to protect the body, the immune system overreacts&#xD;
      to the antigen, which includes the infected cells, which causes a cytokine-storm, and the&#xD;
      subsequent and rapid shut down of the infected individual's organ(s)' structure, leaving the&#xD;
      body without sufficient strength or time to fight back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical herbs can mediate the immunity disorder caused by infections, and mutated cells,&#xD;
      including COVID-19 and its mutations. Our pre-clinical study found that the medical herbs&#xD;
      inhibit the inflammation expression, reduce the chance of cytokine-storm, prevent&#xD;
      deterioration, and reduce the mortality rate. In addition, the T cells can perform their job&#xD;
      when the inflammation is under control. The virus and cancer cells belong to antigens that&#xD;
      should be killed by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. This clinical study aims not to&#xD;
      provide drugs to kill the antigens, but rather to create the necessary conditions inside the&#xD;
      human body to allow the immune system a chance to overcome the antigens. The clinic has used&#xD;
      this treatment concept to successfully treat infected patients and cancer patients.&#xD;
