      Interested patients will be contacted and informed consent obtained. Then, participants will&#xD;
      be assessed through a set of tests and questionnaires to register data regarding: physical&#xD;
      activity; functional capacity; muscle strength; health-related quality of life; symptoms&#xD;
      (dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety and depression); lung function; sociodemographics and&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Six-minutes walking test/distance [6MWT/6MWD]. Patients will be asked to walk as far as possible in 6 min along a flat 30m corridor. Standardised instructions and encouragement will be given during the test, following European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society statement.</description>

    <description>One-minute sit-to-stand [1minSTS]. Patients will sit and stand from a chair, without the aid of the upper limbs, many times as they can in a 1-min bout. Afterwards, the results will be compared to age- and sex-matched reference values.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in isometric quadriceps strength from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Isometric quadriceps strength (dynamometer). A hand-held dynamometer will be used to assess isometric strength of both legs. Participants will be seated at the edge of a treatment table, positioned near their maximal knee extension (0ยบ), and with arms across the chest. The dynamometer will be positioned two fingers width above the lateral malleolus on the anterior aspect of the tibia.&#xD;
Four warm-ups will be allowed, on each at 25, 50, 75, and 100% of perceived effort, gradually building up to a maximal effort over 1 to 2 seconds.&#xD;
The tester will perform two make tests with the subject exerting 100% effort for 3 seconds. Average peak force of the two trials will be used to determine quadriceps muscle performance. The make test will entail the examiner giving appropriate resistance to the muscle force in order to ensure isometric conditions.&#xD;
After allowing 1 minute of rest, the procedure will be repeated at 60ยบ of knee flexion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in handgrip force from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip force (dynamometer). A hand-held dynamometer will be used to measure isometric strength of the grip. Participants will be seated on a straight back chair with both feet flat on the floor. Arm positioning will be demonstrated by the examiner: the tested arm will have the elbow bended to 90ยบ, the forearm and wrist in neutral position, and the fingers flexed as needed for a maximal contraction, while the not-tested arm will assume an adducted and neutrally rotated shoulder position.&#xD;
Subjects will be instructed to breathe in through their nose and blow out through pursed lips while making a maximum grip effort. At this time, a verbal encouragement will be given by the examiner (e.g., &quot;Squeeze! Harder! Harder! Relax!&quot;). Four minutes or more of rest will be allowed between each grip assessment. The average score among 3 trials will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal respiratory pressures will be measured using a specific device; then, the highest value of 3 attempts will be selected to obtain a reliable average, excluding pressure peaks lower than one second. Participants will be asked to sit with their neck and chest in an upright position and their feet flat on the floor. The results will be read using the reference values provided by Black and Hyatt equations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in health-related quality of life from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). The EQ-5D-5L consists of two parts: the descriptive system and a visual analogue scale (VAS). The descriptive system addresses five different dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities. pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each with a five-point Likert-scale; the answering pattern can be transferred to a utility between 0 and 1 (the higher the better) by distinct (nation-specific) scoring algorithms. On the other hand, the VAS allows valuing current health on a 0-100 mm scale, with higher values indicating better health.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in dyspnea symptom from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Dyspnea - modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. The mMRC dyspnea scale consists of five grades of increasing severity. A higher score indicates a greater impact of dyspnea on activities of daily life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in fatigue symptom from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue - Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) scale.&#xD;
The FACIT-F scale consists of many items to produce a global score, and each item can be scored from 0 to 4 (from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very much&quot;). It covers different aspects of fatigue (physical, functional, emotional, and social consequences) with regard to the previous seven days. A higher score reflects less fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in anxiety and depression symptoms from baseline (at hospital discharge or patient's home) at 12 weeks and 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety and depression-The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS consists of two subscales (HADS-A, for anxiety disorders, and HADS-D, for depression) both containing seven intermingled items. A higher score implies a more severe case.</description>
