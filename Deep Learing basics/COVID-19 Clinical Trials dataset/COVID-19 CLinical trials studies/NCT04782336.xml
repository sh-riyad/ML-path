      Collection of Nasal Swabs, Throat Swabs and Saliva Samples from patients presenting at their&#xD;
      designated care or testing facility displaying symptoms of either Influenza, Respiratory&#xD;
      Syncytial Virus (RSV), SARS-CoV-2 or those who have been in recent contact with SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      positive patients. Collected samples will aid the development, calibration and performance&#xD;
      evaluation of the LumiraDx POC Test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      INFORM is a sample collection study targeting a population of patients attending their&#xD;
      designated care or testing facility, suspected of having a respiratory illness typical of&#xD;
      Influenza, RSV or COVID-19 and undergoing a Standard of Care (SOC) test on the day. Or those&#xD;
      who have been in recent contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Participants may be of any&#xD;
      age, there is no upper or lower age limit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional Group (B), has been incorporated into the study, enabling collection from the&#xD;
      asymptomatic population, in order to acquire negative samples (when required), to further aid&#xD;
      the development and on-going calibration of the LumiraDx assays. This group will be&#xD;
      considered for new site's, who do not routinely provide SOC Testing. Inclusions 1 &amp; 2 will&#xD;
      therefore not be applicable to this group. Paediatric participants will not be recruited into&#xD;
      Group B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the facility's viability and agreed contracting, the following study samples&#xD;
      will be collected per patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult Population: Two (2) Nasal, AND/OR Two (2) Throat Swabs AND/OR, One (1) Saliva Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paediatric Population: Two (2) Nasal, OR Two (2) Throat Swabs AND/OR, One (1) Saliva Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once required samples and data have been collected, participation is complete. No follow-up&#xD;
      or subsequent patient involvement is required.&#xD;
