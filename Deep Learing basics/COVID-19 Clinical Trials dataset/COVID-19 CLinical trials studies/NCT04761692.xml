  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study seeks to community knowledge and understand the experience of underserved&#xD;
      communities in the exploration of reducing health disparities and increasing vaccine uptake&#xD;
      and acceptability COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia for AA and Latinx populations. Unique in&#xD;
      its design, it has the following characteristics: 1) multifaceted, 2) culturally tailored, 3)&#xD;
      community-based, and 4) mixed methods in which the outcomes of interest will be measured&#xD;
      before and after the intervention with 18-month interval. Furthermore, we seek to enhance our&#xD;
      partnerships and collaborations with churches in South Los Angeles by supporting efforts to&#xD;
      encourage COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia vaccination uptake among underserved minorities&#xD;
      in one of the most challenged and hard-to-reach population areas in the nation.&#xD;

      This study seeks to augment community knowledge and increase vaccine uptake among&#xD;
      under-resourced African American and Latinx communities in South LA via leveraging trusted&#xD;
      church leaders, educators and influencers to delivering COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia&#xD;
      education on vaccination. Unique in its design, this study has the following characteristics,&#xD;
      beneficial to the acceptability and success of the proposal, it is: 1) multifaceted, 2)&#xD;
      culturally tailored, and 3) community-based, in which the outcomes of interest will be&#xD;
      compared longitudinally between arms 1-3, including measurement before and after the&#xD;
      intervention with 9- and 18-month interval.&#xD;
