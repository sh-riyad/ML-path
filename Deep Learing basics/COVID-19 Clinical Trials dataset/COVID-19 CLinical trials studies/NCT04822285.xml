  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to investigate the effect of the psychological triaging intervention (PTI)&#xD;
      on the psychological distress and resilience capacity levels among the intern-nursing&#xD;
      students during the COVID-19 crisis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intern-nursing students who attend PTI exhibit lower COVID-19 related psychological distress&#xD;
      level and higher resilience capacity than those who receive routine psychological support.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The intern-nursing students' psychological well-being and resilience are of indispensable&#xD;
      significance during these unprecedented days. 64 Intern-nursing students. Sixty-four&#xD;
      intern-nursing students who completed a preliminary survey and demonstrated both high level&#xD;
      of psychological distress and low resilience capacity as a result of their exposure to&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 during their internship period were randomly assigned to two equal&#xD;
      groups and the study group were engaged in the PTI intervention which followed the path of&#xD;
      RAPID Psychological First Aid model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTI intervention followed the path of RAPID Psychological First Aid model of John Hopkins&#xD;
      University (Everly&amp; Lating 2012). The content of the PTI represents a simple structure that&#xD;
      is revolved around five core phases including (R: establishing rapport and reflective&#xD;
      listening, A: assessment, P: prioritization, I: intervention and D: disposition&amp; follow up).&#xD;

    <description>The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was developed by (Goldberg, 1972). The questionnaire comprises 12- self-report items to measure the severity of psychological distress. The presence the symptoms was rated on 4- points Likert-type scale; (0=&quot;not at all present&quot;, 1=&quot;same as usual present&quot;; 2=&quot;rather more than usual present&quot;; 3=&quot;much more than usual present&quot;). The tool demonstrated high reliability as Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.87. The total score ranged from 0-36. The higher score representing higher level of psychological distress.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Resilience Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>&quot; 2 weeks &quot;</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 25-item to assess the resilience capacity. The CD-RISC was abridged to 10 items to reflect the individuals' ability to tolerate painful experience. Such as; ability to adapt to change, tendency to bounce back after hardship and ability to stay focused under pressure.</description>
