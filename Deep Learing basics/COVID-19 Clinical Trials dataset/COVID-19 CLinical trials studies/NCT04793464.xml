  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that causes the severe respiratory illness COVID-19 is the&#xD;
      worst health crisis that the United States has faced in a century. Although this highly&#xD;
      contagious virus has infected millions of Americans already, the disease burdens are&#xD;
      disproportionately born by historically underserved populations such as Latinx communities.&#xD;
      This disparity is notable in Oregon, where the 13% of the population that is Latinx&#xD;
      represents approximately 44% of COVID-19 cases. An urgent need exists to reach Oregon's&#xD;
      Latinx community to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to implement a Promotores de Salud intervention to increase&#xD;
      the reach, access, uptake, and impact of testing in Latinx communities in Oregon. This&#xD;
      project will fully integrate with the National institutes of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration&#xD;
      of Diagnostics (RADx) consortium and its Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC). With&#xD;
      guidance and leadership from the study's Latinx Community and Scientific Advisory Board, 36&#xD;
      testing sites have been established to test the Promotores de Salud intervention. The&#xD;
      investigators will test whether the Promotores de Salud intervention will increase testing&#xD;
      rates and promote better health behaviors in communities over time. The investigators will&#xD;
      test the intervention using a randomized control trial comparing the intervention to county&#xD;
      outreach services as usual. Evaluation of the Promotores de Salud intervention held during a&#xD;
      testing event (compared to distribution of a pamphlet only) will test whether culturally&#xD;
      competent education results in greater use of strategies that reduce transmission of COVID-19&#xD;
      at the community and individual level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a working group structure with teams focused on: Community&#xD;
      Engagement, Molecular Biology, Data Science, and Implementation Science. These working groups&#xD;
      are coordinated by an Administrative Hub and guided by the study's Latinx Community and&#xD;
      Scientific Advisory Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over time, this project will help communities institutionalize optimal local testing&#xD;
      frameworks supported by University of Oregon laboratory facilities for testing capacity,&#xD;
      technical support for testing logistics, and collection of data on health behaviors, testing&#xD;
      rates, and sustainability. The resulting structures and systems will be poised for future&#xD;
      scale-up to other vulnerable communities and/or for other public health purposes (e.g.,&#xD;
      vaccination campaigns).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 36 communities have established a testing site with testing events held every&#xD;
      other week (bi-weekly). The study randomized counties at the site level within county. The&#xD;
      investigators used a priori stratification by county as sample size is small. Half of all&#xD;
      sites in a county were assigned to the control condition (services as usual), and the other&#xD;
      half to the intervention condition (Promotores de Salud). Randomly assigned communities&#xD;
      receive one of two outreach strategies: Services as usual (culturally tailored flyers, radio&#xD;
      announcements, social media posts, health behavior pamphlet on site) or services as usual&#xD;
      plus the Promotores de Salud intervention, where a paid, trusted community member reaches out&#xD;
      to community members to motivate them to utilize the free testing services and improve&#xD;
      COVID-19 related health behaviors. The Promotores de Salud intervention was designed to build&#xD;
      relationships with Latinx community members and facilitate trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the proportion of Latinx community members tested at each site, the investigators&#xD;
      will use de-identified health information provided to the study by the University of Oregon's&#xD;
      (UO) COVID-19 clinical genomics laboratory, who are processing the tests. To assess health&#xD;
      behaviors, a subset of adult participants at each site will be invited to participate in a&#xD;
      research survey, administered at baseline and again 30 days later. For both approaches, the&#xD;
      study anticipates engaging a greater proportion Latinx community members, relative to overall&#xD;
      county demographics. The overall study population is expected to be 85% Hispanic and 15%&#xD;
      non-Hispanic, with 84% of individuals identifying as White in both ethnic groups and the&#xD;
      remaining 16% identifying as African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, American&#xD;
      Indian/Alaska Native, or more than one race. There will be 18 sites per study group (36&#xD;
      total) and up to roughly 3,600 adult individuals assigned to the intervention (n = 1,800) or&#xD;
      control conditions (n = 1,800).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also leverages data from a patient registry from the University of Oregon's&#xD;
      COVID-19 clinical genomics laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance, Data Checks, Source Data Verification, Data Dictionary, and Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures: Data and biospecimens will be collected in-person at testing sites,&#xD;
      requiring direct interaction with participants. In order to report SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      results back to each participant, name, date of birth, and contact information are collected.&#xD;
      To fulfill reporting requirements to the Oregon Health Authority, county of residence and zip&#xD;
      code are also collected for each person tested. Data used to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      intervention will involve aggregate variables derived from data collected as part of the&#xD;
      diagnostic testing procedure and will be aggregated at the level of the testing site (e.g.,&#xD;
      tests performed, race and ethnicity percentages, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the collection of SARS-CoV-2 samples, testing facilitators will guide participants in the&#xD;
      self-collection process. For anterior nares, participants are instructed to place the nasal&#xD;
      swab about 1cm into their nostril and rotate it, making contact with the nasal membrane for&#xD;
      10 seconds, then repeating the process with the same swab in the other nostril. For saliva&#xD;
      collection, participants spit 1 - 5 ml of saliva into a sterile container, which may take a&#xD;
      participant up to 10 minutes to produce. Parents are instructed to collect the sample for&#xD;
      their child if the child is under 10 years old, or if the minor child requests parental&#xD;
      assistance. Testing site staff can assist participants who have low dexterity or physical&#xD;
      impairments in sample collection. In case of an injury during sample collection, the&#xD;
      partnering community organization staff will direct the participant to the appropriate&#xD;
      medical resources. Samples will be placed into sterile barcoded vials (1 ml Matrix, barcoded&#xD;
      screw-cap tubes) that each contain 500 microliters (Î¼l) of DNA/RNA Shield. Each Matrix tube&#xD;
      will then be closed tightly and will be placed in a standard plastic laboratory&#xD;
      microcentrifuge tube rack with eight rows and twelve columns (8-by-12 rack with 96&#xD;
      positions). This rack will then be externally decontaminated by brief submersion in&#xD;
      accelerated hydrogen peroxide (H202). Each 96-position microcentrifuge tube rack will then be&#xD;
      labeled and placed in a sterile temporary container with wet ice at 4Cdegrees. If possible at&#xD;
      each site, racks will be periodically transferred either to a refrigerator (4C) or freezer&#xD;
      (-20C) for storage. At the end of the day all racks will be transported on wet ice to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 clinical genomics Laboratory at UO, ensuring that they will arrive no longer than 48&#xD;
      hours after collection and preferably within 12-24 hours. If the testing site is located too&#xD;
      distally for hand transport, tube racks will be secured and shipped by express methods on dry&#xD;
      ice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 96 well collection plate will next proceed to molecular processing using the standard,&#xD;
      FDA approved Thermo Fisher TaqPath analysis protocol. All steps of this approved protocol&#xD;
      will be followed exactly, including the appropriate reagents, volumes, and inclusion of&#xD;
      appropriate positive and negative controls. In addition, investigators will employ the&#xD;
      software analysis system and parameters exactly as specified. First, RNA will be extracted&#xD;
      from each well using the MagMax Viral/Pathogen Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher,&#xD;
      #100081242) which removes potentially inhibiting contamination and increases the sensitivity&#xD;
      and consistency of subsequent qPCR protocols. Depending upon the number of samples to be&#xD;
      processed, the RNA extraction will either occur by hand using multichannel pipettors or&#xD;
      through the use of the Hamilton Robot. The purified RNA will then be retrotranscribed for&#xD;
      analysis using the TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit on either 96 well or 384 well QuantStudio5&#xD;
      (QS5) thermocyclers depending upon the number of samples to be processed. If the lab&#xD;
      technicians need to process 384 samples, they will use the Hamilton liquid handling robot&#xD;
      (Hamilton, Microlab VANTAGE 2.0) to aliquot from each of four-96 well plates into the 384&#xD;
      well plate format for subsequent qPCR amplification. In this RT-PCR process, probes anneal to&#xD;
      three unique forward and reverse primers for three SARS-CoV-2 genes: ORF1ab, N Protein and S&#xD;
      Protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All laboratory and reporting will be automated through the use of barcodes, robotics, 96 and&#xD;
      384 well qPCR machines, and the use of a fully HIPAA and CAP3 compliant Laboratory&#xD;
      Information Management System (LIMS) built by L7 informatics (https://l7informatics.com/).&#xD;
      These system automations and use of LIMS allow increased throughput (up to several thousand&#xD;
      samples per day) and rapid analysis and automated reporting of results through the LIMS. The&#xD;
      qPCR data are stored in the LIMS system for analysis using the Applied Biosystems COVID-19&#xD;
      Interpretive Software to allow a qualitative assessment of whether the virus is present in&#xD;
      the sample (a 'positive' case), absent, or uncertain. The LIMS system in the COVID-19-MAP lab&#xD;
      allows the integration of this analysis software into the appropriate step of the overall&#xD;
      sample tracking workflow pipeline, and therefore the immediate result can be linked to the&#xD;
      appropriate barcode in the database. Furthermore, the LIMS system is connected and&#xD;
      communicates via a local area network (LAN) with all equipment (e.g., robots and qPCR&#xD;
      machines) to document each step of the process for CLIA validation. The results for each&#xD;
      sample, and associated metadata on the steps during processing, are then associated with each&#xD;
      assigned barcode and can then be disseminated, as appropriate, to the Oregon Health&#xD;
      Authority, the appropriate county health department, and the individual. Test results will be&#xD;
      available within 48 hours and no later than 4 days to the individual and/or the health&#xD;
      authority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After testing occurs, researchers will have access to aggregate, community-level (e.g.,&#xD;
      counts and prevalence rates), de-identified data prepared by the UO's CLIA clinical genomics&#xD;
      laboratory. The data will include three protected health identifiers: site zip code,&#xD;
      participant zip code, and testing date. It will also include demographic data this is not&#xD;
      protected health information such as age range, race, and ethnicity. These data will be used&#xD;
      to assess outreach activities aimed at increasing participation of Latinx community members&#xD;
      in SARS-COV-2 testing. The primary outcome for this aspect of the study is site-level testing&#xD;
      rates of Latinx individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Assessment, Plan for Missing Data, Statistical Analysis Plan: For the primary&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation of the Promotores intervention, the investigators will employ standard&#xD;
      normal theory analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and auto-regressive linear modeling for&#xD;
      continuous outcomes such as COVID-19 knowledge; and they will employ pre-post generalized&#xD;
      linear modeling for count and ordered categorical outcomes such as proportion of Latinx&#xD;
      tested at each geographic site. To address the non-independence of participants in the&#xD;
      intervention design, investigators will estimate linear mixed models. Two primary sources of&#xD;
      missing data are expected, item non-response and attrition over time. For dropout,&#xD;
      investigators will conduct standard attrition analyses to compare baseline characteristics&#xD;
      between attriters and completers. They will consider propensity score matching procedures and&#xD;
      complier average causal effects models to address substantial differences. For item&#xD;
      non-response and scale score development, investigators will require 70% of scale items be&#xD;
      present for scoring. They will test whether scale level data are missing completely at random&#xD;
      (MCAR) within waves and then across waves. If data are not MCAR, under assumptions of missing&#xD;
      at random (MAR, i.e., data are not dependent on missing values of the intervention response&#xD;
      variable), investigators will employ one of two recommended approaches for SEM, full&#xD;
      information maximum likelihood (FIML) or multiple imputation (MI). Although these approaches&#xD;
      can be problematic when data are non-ignorable missing, they are still recommended for&#xD;
      handling missingness, particularly with covariates associated with attrition. Both methods&#xD;
      provide more efficient standard errors than listwise or pairwise deletion, or mean&#xD;
      substitution. Should missing data or attrition be associated with covariates, investigators&#xD;
      will include appropriate covariates in hypothesis testing. For the pre-post individual level&#xD;
      criterion outcomes, 36 sites with roughly 50 to 100 participants per site plus attrition (n =&#xD;
      2160) an alpha level of .05 and intra-class correlations ranging from .05 to .20 provides&#xD;
      power to detect effects ranging from .19 to .32, respectively (small to moderate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, data will be collected in accordance with Tier 1 &quot;common data elements&quot; from the&#xD;
      national Duke Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC). The CDCC directly assists each&#xD;
      individual RADx-UP project to optimize engagement, outreach, testing strategies, and to&#xD;
      facilitate co-learning opportunities between and among RADx-UP projects. Key outcome data and&#xD;
      the testing procedures for obtaining the sample, analysis platform, analysis procedures, and&#xD;
      test resulting will be collected and represented in a consistent manner for harmonization&#xD;
      across the consortium, integrated with test reporting requirements under the Coronavirus Aid,&#xD;
      Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).&#xD;
