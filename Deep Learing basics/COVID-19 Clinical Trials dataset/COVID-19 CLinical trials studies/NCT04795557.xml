      The aim of this clinical trial of a fixed combination of standardized extracts from Rhodiola&#xD;
      rosea roots, Schisandra chinensis berry and Eleutherococcus senticosus root (ADAPT-232) in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients is to demonstrate possible efficacy of adjuvant treatment with ADAPT-232 in&#xD;
      decreasing the duration of the convalescence, alleviation of fatigue, headache, attention&#xD;
      deficit, difficult and rapid respiration, depression, anxiety and other symptoms of Long&#xD;
      COVID-19 during rehabilitation period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale. Currently, numerous clinical trials on efficacy antiviral preparations in COVID-19&#xD;
      patients are in progress, however little is known on effective treatment of comorbid&#xD;
      complications or COVID long-haulers during convalescence, particularly on fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      attention deficit, and depression. The aim of this study is to assess eficacy of an&#xD;
      adaptogenic preparation ADAPT-232 on recovery of COVID-19 Patients in rehabilitation period&#xD;
      after discharge from Intensive Care Units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathogenesis and progression of COVID-19 is multistep process, which requires correct&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy on various steps of initiation of overall defense response to pathogen&#xD;
      and its resolution. Consequently, effective prevention or treatment of COVID-19 requires&#xD;
      pharmaceutical corrections of many components innate, adaptive immune system, phases I-III&#xD;
      metabolizing enzymes of detoxifying and repair systems as well as on the SARS-Cov-2 virus'&#xD;
      life cycle and proliferation. We suggest that It can be achieved by multitarget&#xD;
      pharmaceutical intervention of herbal preparations that have polyvalent and pleiotropic&#xD;
      actions on host defence systems, like adaptogens, which are known as natural&#xD;
      stress-protective compounds or plant extracts that increase adaptability, resilience, and&#xD;
      survival of organisms. In this context, complex mixtures of natural compounds (or herbal&#xD;
      extracts) synergistically targeting multiple elements of molecular networks involved in&#xD;
      inflammatory defence response are presumably more effective than the monodrugs, targeting&#xD;
      only one receptor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptogenic preparations were tested in controlled clinical trials for the treatment of&#xD;
      common cold and associated uncomplicated upper respiratory infections as well as for the&#xD;
      prevention of common colds. The studies confirm their safety and efficacy presumably due to&#xD;
      antiviral, anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic activity. Further studies are required to&#xD;
      evaluate their efficacy in COVID-19 and other viral respiratory invidious diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One more possible benefit of adaptogens in COVID-19 might be their beneficial effect during&#xD;
      convalescence of patents. This indication for use is based on the results of a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo controlled double blind study of Chisan/ADAPT-232 (a fixed combination of three&#xD;
      adaptogenic plants Eleutherococcus senticosus - Rhodiola rosea and Schisandra chinensis) in&#xD;
      pneumonia. The results obtained in that study clearly indicate that adjuvant treatment of&#xD;
      pneumonia patients with Chisan (ADAPT-232) significantly decreases the period of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy required for recovery, decreasing the duration of the acute phase of the illness, and&#xD;
      improves the mental performance of patients during the convalescence period with an&#xD;
      accompanying improvement in the quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADAPT 232Â® is a formulation used in different dosage forms for the enhancement of mental and&#xD;
      physical capacities in case of tiredness or during convalescence. Chisan (ADAPT-232) has been&#xD;
      on the Swedish market as a natural remedy since 1979.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approved indications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sweden: Herbal medicinal product used as an adaptogen in case of decreased performance such&#xD;
      as fatigue and sensation of weakness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Denmark: Herbal medicinal product for fatigue and re-convalescence Canada: Herbal medicine&#xD;
      for the enhancement of mental and physical capacities in case of tiredness or during&#xD;
      convalescence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be recruited by doctors of National Family Medicine Training Centre (NFMTC,&#xD;
      Tbilisi, Georgia), in the course of attendance of patients to clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive medical history will be ascertained by the study doctor. All patients will&#xD;
      have a complete physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Patients with confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis based on positive SARS-Cov-2 test which will be assessed for eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An information about the study in included in patient written consent and will be handed out&#xD;
      to each subject. Before any study related procedures are initiated, all objectives, methods&#xD;
      and potential hazards will be explained verbally to the subject by the investigator in&#xD;
      Georgian language. The subject will be given sufficient opportunity to ask questions about&#xD;
      study details and allowed time to consider the information provided. The subject information&#xD;
      will clearly state that the subjects are completely free to enter or not to enter the study,&#xD;
      or to withdraw from it whenever they want without negative consequences. Subjects will be&#xD;
      informed that personal data will be treated with absolute confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects have to give their written consent before taking part in the study. The Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form must be dated and personally signed by each subject. The Principal Investigator&#xD;
      (or designee) must store the original, signed Informed Consent Form. A copy of the Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form must be given to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schedule of examinations and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;

      Day 21 (Visit 4, Follow up): Clinical examination, Lab Tests (Blood serum cytokin IL-6 ,&#xD;
      D-Dimer, C-reactive protein, Cognitive performance test, Tests for anxiety-depression,&#xD;
      assessment of Long COVID symptoms, Physical activity, Adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21: Patient self-assessment of Long COVID symptoms, Physical&#xD;
      activity and body temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit 1, the investigator informs prospective participants regarding the test&#xD;
      compound, the aims and nature of the study, and offers the opportunity of participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator hands over the study diary - patient's self-assessment forms and Instruction&#xD;
      to the participants and explains how to use it. The log contains questionaries, which should&#xD;
      be filled in during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants fill inn all questionnaires form under guidelines and with help of the&#xD;
      Investigator. The investigator scores participants on the anxiety and depression using HAM-A,&#xD;
      and HADS inventories. Patients provides blood samples for laboratory analysis and complete&#xD;
      d2-test for attention and memory. After completion of all screen and baseline procedures, and&#xD;
      after assuring that all study entry inclusion and exclusion criteria are met, patients sign&#xD;
      the informed consent form. After that they will be randomly assigned to double-blind&#xD;
      treatment with either ADAPT-232, 60 ml daily, or placebo and receive then package with&#xD;
      investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up Study Visits 2-4: Patients will then return for follow up study visits at weeks 2,&#xD;
      3 and 4. Each patient will be evaluated by the study doctor to assess the presence and&#xD;
      severity of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will provide blood samples for laboratory testing and the study doctor will perform&#xD;
      the d2-test HAM-A and HADS ratings. The study doctor will obtain a detailed safety profile of&#xD;
      all adverse events including the dates of occurrence, severity of the event, and relationship&#xD;
      to study medication (i.e., definite, probable, possible, unrelated). Patients will be&#xD;
      specifically instructed by the study doctor not to use these agents during the trial. At each&#xD;
      study visit, vital signs and weight will be obtained by the study coordinator (or a research&#xD;
      nurse). Finally, the amount of oral solution (drug) record will be obtained by doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After visit 3 (two weeks drug administration), no treatment is administered for one week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the last visit 4, patients will provide blood samples for laboratory testing and the study&#xD;
      doctor will perform the d2-test HAM-A and HADS ratings and collects the study diary, and&#xD;
      fill-in the Unused oral solution as well as the empty bottles are gathered. In case the&#xD;
      subject does not report unwanted events, the investigator asks about side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study may be discontinued by participants at any time. Specific reasons for&#xD;
      discontinuation are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      voluntary discontinuation by participants without any prejudice to further treatment, safety&#xD;
      reasons as judged by the Investigator, severe non-compliance to the protocol as judged by the&#xD;
      Investigator, incorrect enrolment i.e. participants do not meet the required&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who discontinue after receiving the treatment will be deblinded and asked to&#xD;
      deliver the remaining liquid to the investigator. All individuals will be asked about the&#xD;
      reason(s) for their discontinuation and the presence of any adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals not meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study should, under no&#xD;
      circumstances, be enrolled into the study - there can be no exception to this rule.&#xD;
      Individuals that do not meet study criteria and are enrolled by mistake, incorrectly&#xD;
      randomized, or subsequently fail to meet criteria for the study should return for the&#xD;
      procedures and assessments to the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are asked to take their daily dose of 60 ml oral solution. Participants will be&#xD;
      questioned about their overall compliance with the study protocol upon their visits and the&#xD;
      remaining tablets will be counted by the study personnel. Compliance will be monitored by the&#xD;
      doctor. He will check patients' records in a special form which will be attached to Case&#xD;
      Report Form (Appendix 8). Doctor will check overall compliance with the study protocol upon&#xD;
      their visits and the remaining liquid will be measured by a measuring cylinder at the end of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management plan (DMP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be handled in accordance with the study's Data Management Plan. The Data&#xD;
      Management Plan (DMP) are developed by the CRO. Staff at the study that are involved in the&#xD;
      data handling process are trained by their respective data manager according to the DMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core data management activities will be carried out in a standardized manner and are&#xD;
      documented properly. DMP describes the complete data handling process in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It contains information about the following aspects: structure of the study database, data&#xD;
      flow, handling of Case Report Forms, monitoring, data entry, data validation activities,&#xD;
      database lock, activities assuring data security and backup, query management, correct&#xD;
      documentation, further applicable documents, clarification of responsibilities. Emerging&#xD;
      problems with and deviations from the DMP will to be reported to the CRO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring of this study will be performed in accordance with the principles of Good&#xD;
      Clinical Practice (GCP) as laid out in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)&#xD;
      document &quot;Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline&quot;. The monitoring includes, whether&#xD;
      all study activities, including documentation and reporting are in accordance with the&#xD;
      applicable SOPs, the study protocol and legal requirements. Monitoring takes place regularly&#xD;
      and will be carried out by the Sponsor and includes source data verification. After&#xD;
      completion of a monitoring visit, a report containing a description of the monitoring&#xD;
      activities and their results is written.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Monitor is given direct access to source data for data verification. Source data&#xD;
      are randomly checked for completeness and plausibility. Moreover, in case of paper-based&#xD;
      source data that are also stored electronically data are also checked for entry errors. That&#xD;
      is, the data-entries are compared with the paper version to check for transcription errors&#xD;
      and omissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Audits and inspections Authorized representatives of Swedish Herbal Institute Research and&#xD;
      Development AB, a regulatory authority or an ethical review board (ERB) may visit the study&#xD;
      sites to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of&#xD;
      such an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study-related&#xD;
      activities and documents to determine whether they were performed in accordance to the&#xD;
      protocol, GCP guidelines and any applicable regulatory requirements. These activities include&#xD;
      the study procedure, data recording, management, analysis and reporting. After termination of&#xD;
      the audit or inspection, main topics and findings are documented in a report. The Principal&#xD;
      Investigator (or designee) should contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by a&#xD;
      regulatory agency about an inspection at his or her center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes to the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the Investigator and&#xD;
      Sponsor. If it is necessary for the study protocol to be amended, the amendment and/or a new&#xD;
      version of the study protocol must be notified and approved by the Sponsor before&#xD;
      implementation. Local requirements must be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case report forms (CRF):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All information collected during the study will be documented independently for each subject&#xD;
      in standardized paper Case Report Forms (CRFs) which are marked with a personal subject&#xD;
      identification number. Data should be recorded legibly onto the CRFs in blue or black&#xD;
      ballpoint pen. Correction fluid or covering labels must not be used. Standardized CRFs are&#xD;
      created by the CRO and distributed to the Sponsor and each participating study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the completed pCRFs will be entered onto National Family Medicine center clinical&#xD;
      study database and validated under direction of the data manger. The data base should follow&#xD;
      for reconciliation of serious adverse events (SAEs) by Swedish Herbal Institute Research and&#xD;
      Development AB drug safety department. Any missing, impossible or inconsistent recordings in&#xD;
      the pCRFs will be referred back to the Investigator using Data Query Forms and be documented&#xD;
      for each individual before clean file status is declared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source data verification will be done by checking printouts of entered data against source&#xD;
      data (i.e., laboratory results, questionnaires). Later questions and corrections will be&#xD;
      noted and verified by the Investigator. Any missing, impossible or inconsistent entries in&#xD;
      the database (or pCRF) will be referred back to the Investigator using data query forms, and&#xD;
      be documented for each individual before clean file status is declared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention-to-Treat analyses of data will take place after termination of the study and&#xD;
      laboratory analyses. Data will be entered twice, and subsequently compared and cleaned for&#xD;
      verification of correct input using the Excel and Prizm programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of subjects' information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' data are handled confidentially. The original data are only accessible for the&#xD;
      Investigator. Subjects' data are encrypted after the study. Pseudonymized data can be&#xD;
      transferred to the Sponsor. Original data is stored securely at NFMTC for ten years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and analytical plans The clinical data at each visit will be recorded using a&#xD;
      standardized clinician assessment form (case reports form - CRF) and collected in an Excel&#xD;
      database, which will be used for further analysis using statistical software GraphPad (San&#xD;
      Diego, CA, USA) Prism software (version 3.03 for Windows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approach for analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes from this study will be&#xD;
      similar. To assess whether the treatment groups are similar at baseline, the mean outcomes&#xD;
      will be compared at baseline for subjects who receive ADAPT-232 vs. placebo by the Student's&#xD;
      parametric independent-measures t-test (variables with normal distribution) or Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      non-parametric test, depending on results of normality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of changes within treatment groups during the study (Visits 1,2,3 and 4) will be&#xD;
      performed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One-way, repeated measures ANOVA (variables with normal distribution),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Friedman test for repeated several measures (nonparametric data),&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy of study medications will be achieved by comparison of mean changes&#xD;
      from the baseline (differences before and after treatment of every single patient) between&#xD;
      groups using two-way between-within ANOVA in which an interaction effect indicates a&#xD;
      different response over time between the two groups and would therefore signal a treatment&#xD;
      effect, as well as by multiple comparison t-test (one unpaired test per row),&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end point was defined as the Duration of the Symptoms. Kaplan-Meier curves will&#xD;
      be generated for all end points, and medians were calculated from those curves. The treatment&#xD;
      arms will be compared by Mantel-Cox log-rank and Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon tests. The estimates&#xD;
      of treatment hazard ratios based on log-rank tests and 95% CIs were calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intergroup comparison of number patients with particular symptoms will be assessed using the&#xD;
      odds ratio (OR) statistics of endpoints according to Altman; A/B test of significance of&#xD;
      differences of endpoints at 95% confidence, and z-statistic at 95% confidence of statistical&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of adverse events will compared across treatment groups for descriptive&#xD;
      purposes and to identify possible differences in the safety profiles using the odds ratio&#xD;
      (OR) statistics of endpoints according to Altman; A/B test of significance of differences of&#xD;
      endpoints at 95% confidence; and z-statistic methods for categorical data&#xD;
      https://www.medcalc.org/calc/odds_ratio.php&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical significance level of 5% was used in the Protocol approved by the health&#xD;
      authorities. Statistical analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis.&#xD;
