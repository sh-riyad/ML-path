    <textblock>
      PATH (Promoting AdolescenT Health) 2 Purpose is a two-arm comparative effectiveness research&#xD;
      trial to that will evaluate the ability of the interventions, Competent Adulthood Transition&#xD;
      with Cognitive-behavioral &amp; Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT) and Teens Achieving Mastery&#xD;
      over Stress (TEAMS), to intervene early to prevent depressive illness and potentially other&#xD;
      common mental health disorders. Using cluster randomization, 564 participants eligible for&#xD;
      the study will be offered one of two different depression prevention programs in multiple&#xD;
      sites in Chicagoland, Rockford, Illinois; Dixon, Illinois; and Louisville, Kentucky. In&#xD;
      response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we will employ a public health&#xD;
      media campaign to recruit a second cohort of 100 adolescents state-wide in Illinois,&#xD;
      Kentucky, and Massachusetts individually randomized to either intervention. The study will&#xD;
      also assess teens', parents' and providers' experiences with each intervention approach.&#xD;
      Finally, we will examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents at-risk for&#xD;
      depression who are enrolled in our study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of mental, emotional and behavioral (MEB) disorders have an initial onset before&#xD;
      age 24, with 20% annual incidence, with major depressive disorder (MDD) being the most common&#xD;
      MEB. Health systems, eager to reduce costs, want to transition from the current &quot;wait until&#xD;
      sick enough for treatment&quot; model for MDD to a preventive model. However, evidence is needed&#xD;
      for (1) the comparative effectiveness of a &quot;scalable intervention&quot; and (2) an implementation&#xD;
      model for such a scalable intervention in the primary care setting. This study is a&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the efficacy of two evidence-based&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral prevention (CBP) programs: Teens Achieving Mastery over Stress (TEAMS),&#xD;
      the &quot;gold standard,&quot; group therapy model, and Competent Adulthood Transition with Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral, Humanistic and Interpersonal Training (CATCH-IT), a scalable, self-directed,&#xD;
      technology-based model. For implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic, TEAMS has&#xD;
      successfully been adapted to an online format and administered online through HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      video conferencing software. For the first cohort, 564 eligible adolescents age 13-18 will be&#xD;
      offered one of two different depression prevention programs using cluster randomization in&#xD;
      multiple sites in urban and suburban Chicago, Illinois; rural Western Illinois, including&#xD;
      Dixon and surrounding towns; and Louisville, Kentucky. Randomization will be blocked into&#xD;
      matched pairs of primary health care clinics and school sites and stratified by race,&#xD;
      ethnicity, rural-urban commuting area codes, and socio-economic disadvantage using the&#xD;
      Distressed Communities Index (DCI) from census-tracked data of each site zip code. A second&#xD;
      cohort of 100 eligible adolescents will be recruited through public health media campaigns in&#xD;
      Illinois, Kentucky, and Massachusetts utilizing the same eligibility criteria as Cohort One.&#xD;
      These participants will connect with the research team by phone, email, web survey, or social&#xD;
      media and will be randomized at the individual-level with equal allocation into treatment&#xD;
      conditions (CATCH-IT or TEAMS). The investigators will comprehensively evaluate&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes and stakeholder-valued moderators of effect at 2, 6, 12, and 18&#xD;
      month assessment points. Using a hybrid clinical trial design that simultaneously examines&#xD;
      implementation process, the study will also assess adolescents', parents' and providers'&#xD;
      experiences (i.e. efficacy, time commitment, cultural acceptability, and implementation cost)&#xD;
      with each intervention approach. A sub-sample of Cohort Two (n=50, 25 from each intervention&#xD;
      arm) will be recruited to participate in open-ended interviews for adolescents to share their&#xD;
      experiences of living with subsyndromal depression, coping during the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      their perceived impact of CATCH-IT or TEAMS on their mood and behavior, and the cultural&#xD;
      contexts in which these experiences occurred.&#xD;
