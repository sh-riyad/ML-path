  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen that causes a&#xD;
      coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19),&#xD;
      which is spreading all over the world. This virus can cause acute respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) with a high fatality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I first-in-human clinical trial, healthy volunteers in two different age&#xD;
      cohorts and two dose cohorts will be vaccinated twice with the candidate vaccine ReCOV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and reactogenicity of the candidate vaccine and&#xD;
      to characterize its immunogenicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 160 participants will receive the following vaccine regime:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, 32 young adult participants (18 to 55 years old) will receive 20μg of ReCOV vaccine on&#xD;
      days 0 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, 32 young adult participants (18 to 55 years old) will receive 40μg of ReCOV vaccine on&#xD;
      days 0 and 21, and 32 old adult participants (56 to 80 years old) will receive 20μg of ReCOV&#xD;
      vaccine on days 0 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 32 old adult participants (56 to 80 years old) will receive 40μg of ReCOV vaccine on&#xD;
      days 0 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same time, 8 participants for each cohort, total 32 participants will receive 0.5ml of&#xD;
      normal saline on days 0 and 21.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and immunogenicity data will be collected throughout the study, which concludes at 12&#xD;
      month after the second dose.&#xD;

             requirements and restrictions listed in the Informed Consent Form (ICF) and in this&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female subjects who are ≥18 years old at the time of Screening (signing the&#xD;
             ICF):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. For the younger adult group: 18 to 55 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. For the older adult group: ≥56 to &lt;80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 35.0 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who are of general good health according to the Investigator's assessment,&#xD;
             based on a complete medical history without major pathology, and as determined by&#xD;
             medical evaluation (including physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), vital&#xD;
             signs, and clinical laboratory tests). Subjects in the older adult population who have&#xD;
             medically stable, well-controlled comorbidities may be enrolled at the discretion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             NOTE: All clinical laboratory values should be within reference ranges unless&#xD;
             confirmed by Investigator or delegate as not clinically significant. One repeat&#xD;
             evaluation of ECG, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests will be permitted, at&#xD;
             the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects who test negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibodies (anti-HBc), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies, and anti-human&#xD;
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 and 2 antibodies at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who test negative for SARS-Cov-2 infection, based on a reverse transcriptase&#xD;
             polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and serological test for SARS-COV-2 IgM and/or&#xD;
             IgG antibodies at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects are eligible to participate if not pregnant, not breastfeeding, and at&#xD;
             least 1 of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP), defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Surgically sterile (documented hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or&#xD;
                  bilateral oophorectomy, as confirmed by review of the subject's medical records,&#xD;
                  medical examination, or medical history interview), or Postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
                  no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level in the postmenopausal range may be used&#xD;
                  to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or&#xD;
                  hormonal replacement therapy [HRT]. However, in the absence of 12 months of&#xD;
                  amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient). Female subjects on HRT and&#xD;
                  whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non estrogen&#xD;
                  hormonal highly effective contraception methods from Day 1 until at least 6&#xD;
                  months after the second dose of IP if they wish to continue their HRT during the&#xD;
                  study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
                  postmenopausal status before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Is a WOCBP who agrees to use a highly effective method of contraception&#xD;
                  consistently and correctly from Day 1 until at least 6 months after the second&#xD;
                  dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Nonsterilized male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential are&#xD;
             eligible to participate if they agree to ONE of the following from Day 1 until at&#xD;
             least 6 months after the second dose of IP and refrain from donating sperm during this&#xD;
             period:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred&#xD;
                  lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain&#xD;
                  abstinent.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Agree to use a male condom and have their partner use of a contraceptive method&#xD;
                  with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a&#xD;
                  WOCBP who is not currently pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male subjects with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain&#xD;
                  abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each&#xD;
                  episode of penile penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects are excluded from the study if ANY of the following criteria apply at any&#xD;
             time starting from Screening up to Day 1 prior to IP administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. History of clinically significant and uncontrolled hematological, renal,&#xD;
                  endocrine, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, or&#xD;
                  neurologic disease in the opinion of the Investigator within 12 months prior to&#xD;
