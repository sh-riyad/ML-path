    <textblock>
      In this study, we seek to document (i) migrant worker's trust in their host country's&#xD;
      government, (ii) migrant worker's exposure to unreliable COVID-19 information (i.e., rumours)&#xD;
      and (iii) the situational and demographic variables that predict degree of exposure to&#xD;
      unreliable information during the coronavirus-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trust in institutions is vital for effective pandemic response as it lowers fear and&#xD;
      increases compliance. Access to reliable information is a key factor in fostering trust.&#xD;
      However, migrant workers are a disadvantaged population that traditionally lack access to&#xD;
      reliable sources of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we seek to document (i) migrant worker's trust in their host country's&#xD;
      government, (ii) migrant worker's exposure to unreliable COVID-19 information (i.e.,&#xD;
      rumours), (iii) the situational and demographic variables that predict degree of exposure to&#xD;
      unreliable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was taken from the COVID-19 Migrant Health Study, a cross-sectional study of male&#xD;
      migrants employed in manual labor jobs within Singapore.&#xD;
