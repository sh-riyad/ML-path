    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION: As this is a new disease, the short- and long-term consequences for patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19 are still unclear. The use of sedatives, as well as prolonged rest, can lead to&#xD;
      musculoskeletal damage, including decreased muscle strength and physical function. Thus,&#xD;
      rehabilitation after this disease is a key component in continuing patient care. OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
      To verify the effects of face-to-face cardiac rehabilitation and telerehabilitation on&#xD;
      tolerance to the maximum and submaximal exercise, lung function, fatigue intensity and&#xD;
      quality of life of COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: This is a longitudinal, intervention study.&#xD;
      Primary outcomes will be maximum and submaximal functional capacity, intensity and impact of&#xD;
      fatigue, while secondary outcomes will be lung function and quality of life. EXPECTED&#xD;
      RESULTS: This work will bring important information to the scientific community and health&#xD;
      professionals, about the best forms of intervention and its repercussions on the surviving&#xD;
      individuals of COVID-19.&#xD;

    <description>Aerobic training will be performed with 60% to 80% of the maximum VO2 obtained through the CPET. The exercise will be performed on the treadmill, with a total time of 40 minutes, with 5 minutes of warm-up, 30 minutes of conditioning, 5 minutes of cooling down. Resistance training will be performed for upper and lower limbs and the load used in the exercises will be 60% of the maximum repetition test (1RM), with load progression every six sessions. The exercises are performed in three series of 12 repetitions.</description>

    <description>The telerehabilitation protocol will consist of stretching the muscles of the upper and lower limbs and accessory muscles of breathing. The conditioning phase will consist of stationary walking, side running, jumping jump and stationary running, 3 times of 40 seconds with a 30-second passive rest interval between them. Resistance training will be applied to the muscles of the upper limbs and lower limbs, with specific exercises for each musculature, using elastic bands as resistance.</description>
