    <textblock>
      Multiple monoclonal antibodies (mABs) have been shown to reduce viral burden and improve&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, have been granted FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for use in select&#xD;
      populations, and are routinely used in the UPMC Health System, which has made expanded access&#xD;
      a priority. However, the comparative effectiveness of these mABS is unknown. The National&#xD;
      Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has called for expanded access and clinical&#xD;
      use of mABs, noting it is &quot;critical to collect data and evaluate whether they are working as&#xD;
      predicted&quot;. This pragmatic evaluation will determine the relative effects of the EUA-governed&#xD;
      mABs versus each other&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While COVID-19 vaccination will reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality, the learned&#xD;
      immune response may vary between individuals. This means interventions such as monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies (mAB) will still be needed to prevent progression of COVID-19 illness. Monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies seek to mimic or enhance the natural immune system response against a pathogen and&#xD;
      are often used in the care of patients with cancer or infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For viral infections, mABs are created by exposing a white blood cell to a particular viral&#xD;
      protein, which is then cloned to mass produce antibodies to target that virus. For&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, IgG1 mABs target the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      and block viral attachment and entry into cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SARS-CoV-2 mABs bamlanivimab and etesevimab, and the REGN-COV2 combination (casirivimab +&#xD;
      imdevimab) reduce nasopharyngeal viral burden plus clinical outcomes including future&#xD;
      emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Each received FDA Emergency Use&#xD;
      Authorization (EUA) for use in selected populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of February 2021, there are over 60,000 new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed daily in the US,&#xD;
      with over 7000 daily COVID-19 related hospital admissions. Although case volumes are&#xD;
      currently declining, COVID-19 remains a significant public health threat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the EUAs, the clinical use of mABs is low due in part to lack of patient access,&#xD;
      complexities in drug allocation, and lack of knowledge among providers are contributing&#xD;
      factors. Further, the comparative effectiveness of different mABs is unknown and not yet&#xD;
      directly studied. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently&#xD;
      called for expanded access and clinical use of mABs, noting it is &quot;critical to collect data&#xD;
      and evaluate whether they are working as predicted&quot;. This evaluation seeks to determine their&#xD;
      relative effects versus each other, starting with those governed by EUAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 mABs are routinely used at UPMC and which mAB is assigned by pharmacies is&#xD;
      haphazard. Once any order for mAB infusion is approved by the UPMC system oversight group,&#xD;
      the pharmacy provides whichever EUA-governed mAB is available under a therapeutic interchange&#xD;
      approach. Ordering physicians review with the patient the EUA Fact Sheet for each mAB, and&#xD;
      explain that the patient could receive any of the mABs governed by FDA EUAs. If demand for&#xD;
      mAB exceeds supply, UPMC has a lottery system to allot who receives the therapy once&#xD;
      requested by a physician. This pragmatic evaluation embraces and extends the current lottery&#xD;
      system and therapeutic interchange policy for EUA-governed mABs for COVID-19, using an&#xD;
      embedded assignment system akin to current mAb provision. This embedded system structures&#xD;
      assignment to allow a clearer examination of care as a clarity measure for quality&#xD;
      improvement. This system will allow a comparative effectiveness evaluation of the multiple&#xD;
      mABs by effectively ensuring random allocation. As per standard UPMC pharmacy therapeutic&#xD;
      interchange policy for all medications, the Physician can agree to the assigned mAB or can&#xD;
      request a specific mAB. As per EUA requirements, patients will be counseled by their&#xD;
      Physician about mABs and provided EUA Fact Sheets.&#xD;
