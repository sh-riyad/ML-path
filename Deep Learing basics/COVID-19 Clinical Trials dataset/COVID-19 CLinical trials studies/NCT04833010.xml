    <measure>Reaction time of cognitive performance testing during cardiopulmonary exercise test on a cycle ergometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive testing will take place at the end of each stage of the CPET. Cognitive testing using the SACL Cognition application on iPad will include a baseline SRT measurement and additional measurements at the end of each stage of the CPET. The baseline will include a 30s session of SRT for familiarization and then a 30s session will be scored. SRT will then be administered for 30s at the end of each stage of the CPET. The SRT task includes a visual stimulus presented on the touchscreen. Subjects will be instructed to press the stimulus on-screen as quickly as possible. Reaction time will be measured on the SRT task. Reaction time is calculated as the average amount of time in seconds between stimulus presentation and user response within a session.</description>
