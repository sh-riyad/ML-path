  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to learn if ixazomib, given with dexamethasone, stops the&#xD;
      cancer from getting worse in people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. It will be&#xD;
      compared to another medicine called pomalidomide, given with dexamethasone with people with&#xD;
      the same condition. Relapsed means the previous cancer treatment stopped working, over time.&#xD;
      Refractory means they did not respond to previous cancer treatment. Another aim is to check&#xD;
      for side effects from the study medicines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. Participants who can take&#xD;
      part will be picked for 1 of 2 treatments by chance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib capsules, given with dexamethasone tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pomalidomide capsules, given with dexamethasone tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take their study medicine on specific days during a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1st dose of study medicines in each 28-day cycle will take place in the clinic, The other&#xD;
      doses of the study medicines will be taken at home. This will happen for 6 cycles. After&#xD;
      this, all study medicines will be taken at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will visit the clinic every 12 weeks for a check-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants cannot attend their clinic for an important reason (for example, due to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic), the clinic will make alternative arrangements using their local&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have RRMM. This study will compare the efficacy and safety in participants who&#xD;
      take ixazomib and dexamethasone to pomalidomide and dexamethasone. It is an open-label, Phase&#xD;
      2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 120 participants. Participants will receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib 4 mg + dexamethasone 20 mg (or 10 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg (or 20 mg if participant is aged &gt;=75 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take either ixazomib plus dexamethasone (in cases where&#xD;
      only 4 mg tablets for dexamethasone are available, the following dexamethasone schedule is&#xD;
      recommended for participants aged &gt;=75 years: 12 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 1, 8,&#xD;
      15, and 22 of every 28-day cycle; and 8 mg dexamethasone will be given on Days 2, 9, 16, and&#xD;
      23 of every 28-day cycle) or pomalidomide 4 mg + dexamethasone 40 mg at recommended doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this&#xD;
      study is approximately 28 months after the first participant enters the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic, and will be contacted for PFS&#xD;
      follow-up, in case of study drug discontinuation for up to 4 years from first dose&#xD;
      administration. After disease progression, participants will be followed-up for OS every 12&#xD;
      weeks until death or up to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative methods for administering study procedures/assessments may be considered when it&#xD;
      is not possible for the participants to come to the study site due to extenuating&#xD;
      circumstances (e.g., due to the COVID-19 pandemic).&#xD;

    <measure>HRQOL Based on EORTC QLQ-C30 Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 contains 30 items across 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 9 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties) and a global health status/quality of life (QOL) scale. Most of the 30 items have 4 response levels (not at all, a little, quite a bit, and very much), with 2 questions relying on a 7-point numeric rating scale. Raw scores are converted into scale scores ranging from 0 to 100. For the functional scales and the global health status/QOL scale, higher scores represent better QOL; for the symptom scales, lower scores represent better QOL.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 has 20 items across 4 independent subscales, 2 functional subscales (body image, future perspective), and 2 symptoms scales (disease symptoms, and side effects of treatment). Scores are averaged, and transformed to 0-100 scale. For the future perspective scale, higher score is equal to (=) better perspective of the future. For the body image scale, higher scores = better body image. Higher score for the disease symptoms scale = higher level of symptomatology.</description>

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 domains: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), each rated on 5 levels. 1= no problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4= severe problems, 5= extremely severe problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 centimeter (cm), vertical, visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). The scores from all dimensions are combined into a single index score that is reported.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must have a confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) requiring therapy according&#xD;
             to IMWG criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must have had a relapse or PD after having received 2 or more prior lines of systemic&#xD;
             therapy. Note: A line of therapy is defined as 1 or more cycles of a planned treatment&#xD;
             program; this may consist of 1 or more planned cycles of single-agent therapy or&#xD;
             combination therapy, as well as a sequence of treatments administered in a planned&#xD;
             manner. For example, a planned treatment approach of induction therapy followed by&#xD;
             autologous SCT, followed by maintenance is considered 1 line of therapy. Typically&#xD;
             each line of therapy is separated by PD. Discussion with the medical monitor may help&#xD;
             clarify the number of lines of therapy that a prospective study participant had.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be refractory to lenalidomide, defined as having received at least 2 consecutive&#xD;
             cycles of lenalidomide as a single agent or within a lenalidomide-containing regimen&#xD;
             and having had PD during treatment with or within 60 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             lenalidomide. The starting dose of lenalidomide should have been 25 mg (or as low as&#xD;
             10 mg in the case of renal function impairment or other safety concern), and the final&#xD;
             dose should have been a minimum of 10 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have received at least 2 consecutive cycles of a bortezomib- or&#xD;
             carfilzomib-containing regimen, and either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Achieved at least a PR and did not have PD during treatment with or within 60&#xD;
                  days after the last dose of bortezomib or carfilzomib, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Had bortezomib and/or carfilzomib intolerance (defined as discontinuation because&#xD;
                  of drug-related adverse events [AEs] before completion of the planned treatment&#xD;
                  course) without PD before the start of the next regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have measurable disease defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;

             pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Recovered (that is, less than or equal to [&lt;=] Grade 1 nonhematologic toxicity) from&#xD;
             the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be willing and able to adhere to pomalidomide-related risk mitigation activities&#xD;
             if randomized to the pom+dex arm (example, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies&#xD;
             [REMS], pregnancy prevention programs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior allogenic bone marrow transplantation in any prior line of therapy or prior&#xD;
