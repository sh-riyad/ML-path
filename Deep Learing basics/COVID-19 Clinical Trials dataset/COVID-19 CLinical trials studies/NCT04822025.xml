  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 vaccine&#xD;
      in two different dose forms in participants who are generally healthy or with stable&#xD;
      pre-existing health conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blinded (investigator/site staff and&#xD;
      participants; Sponsor open), dose-comparison, multi-center study. Participants who are&#xD;
      generally healthy or with stable pre-existing health conditions will be randomized,&#xD;
      stratified by comorbidity. All eligible participants will be randomized to receive 2 doses of&#xD;
      either High-dose or Mid-dose of MVC-COV190 in a predefined ratio.&#xD;
