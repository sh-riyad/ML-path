  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, 1031 (8.7%) of the 11875 kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients being followed up at Hospital do Rim have been infected. The overall lethality&#xD;
      rate was 24%, reaching 53% among those over 70 years old. Among the survivors, there is also&#xD;
      a high incidence of renal dysfunction with loss of the renal graft and definitive return to&#xD;
      dialysis. Patients receiving pharmacological immunosuppression, including transplant&#xD;
      recipients, have not been included in the studies carried out to date. In addition, kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients may have reduced vaccine responses compared to the general population.&#xD;
      The severity, the high incidence of renal dysfunction and loss of renal graft, and the high&#xD;
      lethality associated with COVD-19 justify the investigation of the epidemiological impact and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
