      The goal of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of a remotely delivered brief&#xD;
      behavioral activation intervention to decrease the negative physical and psychological&#xD;
      consequences of being homebound among older adults during the time of COVID.The intervention&#xD;
      will focus on decreasing the impact of social isolation, inactivity and poor nutrition on old&#xD;
      people during a time when many in-person social activities are not possible. It will be&#xD;
      delivered through telephone and other communication tools that allow remote (i.e. not in&#xD;
      person) communication over 10 sessions. Subjects will be a total of 60 people aged 75 years&#xD;
      an older, who will be recruited from primary care in the Boston MA region and senior living&#xD;
      facilities in the Baltimore MD region. Coaches will be trained using an on-line based modules&#xD;
      developed to support this intervention. Self-report outcomes will be measured by telephone at&#xD;
      baseline and 4-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This project is a single-group unblinded feasibility study to explore a new telephone-based behavioral activation intervention to support homebound older people. If this intervention appears to be feasible, acceptable, and to show preliminary evidence of efficacy the aim will be to evaluate it in a phase III efficacy trial.</intervention_model_description>
