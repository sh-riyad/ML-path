  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of COVID-19 on body systems and functions are still being investigated. ACE 2,&#xD;
      which plays a key role in the entry of the COVID-19 virus into the cell, is also highly&#xD;
      expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina, and placenta in the female genital system, which can&#xD;
      also pose a risk to female reproductive health. The aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      menstrual cycle-induced pain, fatigue, anxiety, and physical activity in women who suffered&#xD;
      from COVID-19.&#xD;

      The effects of COVID-19 on body systems and functions are still being investigated. ACE 2,&#xD;
      which plays a key role in the entry of the COVID-19 virus into the cell, is also highly&#xD;
      expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina, and placenta in the female genital system, which can&#xD;
      also pose a risk to female reproductive health. It has been examined that menstruation volume&#xD;
      decreased or cycle lengthened in one-fifth of women who had COVID-19, and this condition was&#xD;
      more intense in those who had severe COVID-19. Studies have shown that the possible effects&#xD;
      of COVID-19 on the female genital system often remain theoretical hypotheses. In the&#xD;
      literature, there was no study in which menstrual dysfunctions and secondary problems caused&#xD;
      by the state of inactivity entering our lives during pandemic were discussed in a wide&#xD;
      spectrum of women who had COVID-19. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate menstrual&#xD;
      cycle-induced pain, fatigue, anxiety and physical activity in women who suffered from&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Menstrual Symptom Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was developed to assess menstrual pain and symptoms. It is a five-point Likert-type scale consisting of 24 items. Participants will be asked to give a number between 1 (never) and 5 (always) to their menstrual symptoms. Total score will be calculated by taking the total score of the items in the scale. Increasing the average score indicates that the severity of menstrual symptoms increased.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire- Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The short form of the questionnaire, which includes &quot;last seven days&quot;, consists of seven questions and provides information about sitting, walking, moderately vigorous activities and time spent on vigorous activities. The calculation of the total score for the short form includes the sum of time (minutes) and frequency (days) of walking, moderate vigorous activity, and vigorous activity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Each question in this scale consisting of Likert type questions: (1) I strongly disagree (2) I do not attend (3) I tend not to participate (4) I am indecisive (5) I tend to join (6) I participate (7) It is scored as I strongly agree. A score of 4 or higher on the questions indicates severe fatigue. The scoring of the scale, which consists of 9 questions in total, varies between 9 and 63, while a total score of 36 and above indicates fatigue.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Of Coronavirus Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The questionnaire has a five-point Likert type rating and consists of 5 items. &quot;0: none&quot;, &quot;1: rarely, less than a day or two&quot;, &quot;2: a few days&quot;, &quot;3: more than 7 days,&quot; They will be asked to rank the options &quot;,&quot; 4: almost every day during the last two weeks &quot;according to the five elements of the scale.</description>
