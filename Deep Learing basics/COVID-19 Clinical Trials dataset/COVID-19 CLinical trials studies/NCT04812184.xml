      Methods 123 patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial at Eskenazi Hospital from&#xD;
      April 2020 until October 2020. We permitted patients to either use their own mask (due to low&#xD;
      resources institutionally) or we provided a surgical/cloth mask (early on relied on donated&#xD;
      cloth masks for patients). Patients were randomized to a control (no tape over the mask/nose)&#xD;
      or to the intervention (placing tape over the bridge of the nose of the face mask). Patients&#xD;
      were evaluated at 30- and 60- minute intervals to assess for proper mask usage.&#xD;

      Study Design and Setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized control trial at Eskenazi Hospital ED from April 2020 until&#xD;
      October 2020. Eskenazi Hospital is a busy, urban, academic hospital, level 1 trauma center,&#xD;
      in downtown Indianapolis. Here we serve a racially diverse, underserved population, with over&#xD;
      100,000 annual ED visits. This work was approved by the Indiana University Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board (protocol #2004425945).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients presenting to the ED were screened for enrollment in this study by trained&#xD;
      research personnel. All patients are required to wear facial coverings while in the ED, and&#xD;
      after screening patients based on the exclusion criteria provided below, patients were&#xD;
      offered enrollment in the study. Patients were randomly identified by their bed location in&#xD;
      the ED via a random number generator. Patients were excluded from the study for: (1)&#xD;
      pregnant; (2) prisoner; (3) not English or Spanish speaking (currently a large cohort of&#xD;
      ethnic Latino/Latina/Hispanic are utilizing the ED and we can use interpreters to interpret&#xD;
      for enrollment); (4) intoxicated or decompensated psychiatric illness; (5) presenting to the&#xD;
      ED with a life-threatening condition; (6) allergic to standard tape and/or tegaderm. Patient&#xD;
      consent was obtained if an individual agreed to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients included in this study were approached and offered enrollment in a study for&#xD;
      addressing PPE. The control arm consisted of no active intervention, with the treatment arm&#xD;
      placing standard surgical tape over the bridge of the nose to adhere the top of the mask to&#xD;
      the bridge of the nose, thereby creating a physical barrier from removing the mask from the&#xD;
      face. Patients were reevaluated at 30 minutes and 60 minutes after enrollment to assess for&#xD;
      proper mask compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Assuming 50% current compliance, 58 patients per arm were needed to have an 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a 25% difference assuming a two-sided chi-square test and alpha = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this trial is proper mask utilization upon reevaluation at 30 and 60&#xD;
      minutes, with the mask at/under the chin, meanwhile completely covering the mouth and nose).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes of this trial were comparing the primary demographic and visit related&#xD;
      covariates on initial screening, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, past medical history,&#xD;
      social history, chief complaint, and disposition (admission vs. discharge).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient demographics and characteristics were compared between the control and treatment&#xD;
      groups. To test for differences between groups, Microsoft excel statistical package was&#xD;
      utilized, and the Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      for continuous variables.&#xD;
