    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the performance of the BD Veritor™ Plus System for&#xD;
      Rapid Detection of SARS-CoV-2, used in serial testing, in identification of infectious,&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals. This information may be used to inform development of an effective&#xD;
      testing strategy by policy makers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, observational, diagnostic evaluation study is designed to&#xD;
      assess the performance of the BD Veritor System in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in&#xD;
      asymptomatic individuals compared to viral culture and a commercially available RT-PCR assay&#xD;
      over multiple testing time points. The study will enroll a minimum of 150 asymptomatic, adult&#xD;
      participants who test positive for SARS-CoV-2 during community/traveler screening procedures.&#xD;

    <description>Potential participants will be recruited at study sites where they are admitted/held for COVID-19 isolation. On the first day of isolation (ideally on the day they first test positive for SARS-CoV-2), potential participants will be asked to participate in the study. After consent (Study Day 0), two nasopharyngeal swabs (NP swabs) and one nasal swab will be collected. One NP swab will be tested via viral culture and the other nasal swab will be tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The nasal swab will be tested on the BD Veritor System. Specimen collection and testing will be repeated every 2 days for 6 days (Study Day 2, Day 4, and Day 6) or until the RT-PCR Ct value is &gt;30, whichever comes first. Participants will be monitored for symptoms of COVID-19 throughout the study.</description>

        Participants will be recruited at study sites from individuals admitted for SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
        isolation. Once enrolled, participants may be transferred to a different care unit, or&#xD;
        units, throughout their time in the study depending on their medical needs.&#xD;
