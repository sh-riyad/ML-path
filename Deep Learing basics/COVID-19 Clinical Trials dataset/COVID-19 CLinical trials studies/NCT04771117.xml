      The aim of this study is to identify the risk factors favoring the contagion of COVID-19 by&#xD;
      studying the quarantine behavior and preventive measures in the Mexican population. As a&#xD;
      secondary aim, the investigators sought to identify areas that need reinforcement, to help&#xD;

    <description>The Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a questionnaire that evaluates fear of the global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2. The FVC-19S consists of seven items, such as &quot;It makes me uncomfortable to think about coronavirus-19,&quot; &quot;I am afraid of losing my life because of coronavirus-19,&quot; and &quot;When watching news and stories about coronavirus-19 on social media, I become nervous or anxious,&quot; each with a five-point Likert scale of options. The participant is instructed to choose the option that best represents their perception about the statement presented. The maximum possible total is 35 points. The scale's authors indicate that the higher the score is, the higher is the level of the participants' fear of COVID-19.</description>
