    <textblock>
      Gangrenous cholecystitis is the most common complication of acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data showed that COVID-19 patients have a high risk to present necrotic&#xD;
      cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cholecystitis under COVID-19 pandemic WSES (ChoCO-W) study aims to investigate risk&#xD;
      factors and high-risk patients to develop necrotic cholecystitis during this pandemic and&#xD;
      their management.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gangrenous cholecystitis is the most common complication of acute cholecystitis affecting&#xD;
      around 15% (range 2-30%) of patients and it occurs as a result of ischemia with necrosis of&#xD;
      the gallbladder wall [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is related to an increased mortality rate (mortality rate ranging between 15 and 50%)&#xD;
      compared with non-necrotic acute cholecystitis[2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective studies that investigated risk and predictive factors related to gangrenous&#xD;
      cholecystitis showed that males, older patients with diabetes, coronary artery disease, and&#xD;
      other comorbidities are at risk to present with gangrenous cholecystitis. [1-3] Another study&#xD;
      identified longer delay time prior to hospital admission and low white blood cell count as&#xD;
      independent risk factors affecting mortality and indicated the presence of diabetes mellitus,&#xD;
      higher blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase and total bilirubin, pericholecystic fluid in abdominal ultrasonography, and&#xD;
      conversion from laparoscopic surgery to open surgery as risk factors increasing mortality [2]&#xD;
      In any case, the treatment of GC is similar to that of patients with AC but in the presence&#xD;
      of GC, cholecystectomy can be difficult because of adhesions, insufficient anatomic control,&#xD;
      complications like bleeding, and injury to bile ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is high variability in the reported conversion rate to be 30% to 50% [4], down to 8.7%&#xD;
      [5]. These results are probably due to a careful preoperative selection of patients for&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy and early surgery [6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hunt et al [7] reported decreased morbidity and mortality rates with the implementation of&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy for GC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Onder et al [2] showed that mortality was higher in cases in which conversion to open surgery&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, many authors reported necrotic and perforated cholecystitis as the most common&#xD;
      complication of COVID-19 pneumonia [8-9-10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent multi-society position paper suggested to consider percutaneous drainage of the&#xD;
      gallbladder after the failure of conservative therapy with antibiotics but highlighted that&#xD;
      advanced age, or other factors of higher COVID-19 risk, cannot be regarded as sufficient to&#xD;
      indicate this alternative treatment except in real conditions of the impracticability of&#xD;
      cholecystectomy [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lack of evidence and guidelines about the management of a patient with acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, at most preceded by&#xD;
      percutaneous trans-gallbladder drainage (PTGBD) in high surgical risk patients, remains the&#xD;
      gold standard for the treatment of acute cholecystitis on COVID-19 patients, with high&#xD;
      morbidity rate and length of hospital stay that increases the risk of spreading the virus&#xD;
      among health care staff and negative COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the incidence and mortality of necrotic cholecystitis among Covid&#xD;
      (+) patients under the COVID-19 pandemic, to improve their management and to confirm that&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection is a risk factor for necrotic cholecystitis; to assess the management of&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigate the risk factors to develop necrotic cholecystitis under the COVID-19&#xD;
           pandemic;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the management of acute cholecystitis focusing on treatments and outcomes of&#xD;
           the operative or non-operative management in COVID (+) and COVID (-) patients to improve&#xD;
           outcomes, decreasing morbidity and mortality rates related to emergency setting and&#xD;
           high-risk patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirm that COVID-19 disease is a risk factor for necrotic cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the incidence of necrotic cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic among Covid&#xD;
      patients; Evaluate the prevalence of necrotic cholecystitis in patients presenting with acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis during the COVID-19 pandemic; Evaluate the risk factors for necrotic&#xD;
      cholecystitis in COVID-19 patients and negative ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confirm the hypothesis that COVID-19 infection is a risk factor for necrotic cholecystitis;&#xD;
      Evaluate the clinical outcomes of early (&lt;72h from the onset of symptoms) versus delayed&#xD;
      (&gt;72h from the onset of symptoms) cholecystectomy, and of a non operative management&#xD;
      according to the WSES international guidelines (2020) for the management of calculus&#xD;
      cholecystitis and Tokyo severity classification for cholecystitis, in terms of mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints To evaluate the prevalence of necrotic cholecystitis among patients&#xD;
      admitted for acute cholecystitis during the Covid-19 pandemic; The incidence of necrotizing&#xD;
      cholecystitis in the cohort of COVID-19 positive patients; To assess mortality due to&#xD;
      necrotic cholecystitis during the Covid-19 pandemic among Covid-19 infected patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints To investigate the risk factors for necrotic cholecystitis in patients&#xD;
      admitted with diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and in the cohort of Covid-19 patients; to&#xD;
      investigate if the COVID-19 infection is a risk factor to present necrotic cholecystitis; to&#xD;
      assess the management of acute cholecystitis during Covid-19 pandemic and the role of non&#xD;
      operative management strategy and operative management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      International Observational Prospective Cohort Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients admitted to the surgical department with a diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis (with and without necrotising cholecystitis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients of all age and sex admitted in the emergency department for acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis, aged &gt;=18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients aged&lt; 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period April 2021-September 2021&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection All epidemiological, clinical, surgical and follow up data will be collected&#xD;
      on an online case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation This is an explorative study and data will be used to investigate&#xD;
      risk factors, prevalence of necrotic cholecystitis among patients admitted with diagnosis of&#xD;
      acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic, and the specific characteristics behind the&#xD;
      choice between early cholecystectomy, delayed cholecystectomy, radiological drainage of the&#xD;
      gallbladder and medical treatment (antibiotics) in an emergency setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We calculated the sample size by considering the incidence of necrotic cholecystitis reported&#xD;
      in literature which corresponds to a range of 2-30%. Taking into account the mean between the&#xD;
      2 values, and in the lack of data on the incidence of necrotic cholecystitis in Covid&#xD;
      patients, that we assumed to be double the incidence of necrotic cholecystitis in non-Covid&#xD;
      population, with an alfa risk estimated error equal to 0.05, the study population will be&#xD;
      composed of 2 cohorts of 111 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis This is a study evaluating the prevalence of necrotic cholecystitis&#xD;
      among patients admitted for acute cholecystitis during COVID-19 pandemic and the incidence of&#xD;
      necrotic cholecystitis in Covid (+) patients. An univariate and multivariate analysis of each&#xD;
      scheduled parameter will be carried out. In the statistical analysis, the investigator will&#xD;
      differentiate data by cohorts (Covid (-) and Covid (+) patients) and gender. The main aim of&#xD;
      this study is to assess the management of all patients having acute cholecystitis during&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In hospital mortality among patients with acute necrotic cholecystitis In hospital mortality&#xD;
      among Covid-19 patients presenting with acute necrotic cholecystitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints To assess the risk factors for necrotic cholecystitis in Covid+ patients;&#xD;
      To evaluate the management of acute cholecystitis during the Covid-19 pandemic (medical&#xD;
      treatment, surgical treatment, medical treatment and radiological drainage of the&#xD;
      gallbladder); To confirm that COVID-19 infection is a risk factor for developing necrotic&#xD;
      cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
