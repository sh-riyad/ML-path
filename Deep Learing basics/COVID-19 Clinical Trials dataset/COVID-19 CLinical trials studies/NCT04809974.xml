  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess whether Niagen, a safe dietary supplement, improves recovery of&#xD;
      COVID-19 related symptoms in individuals who were infected at least 2 months prior to study&#xD;
      entry (&quot;Long-COVID&quot; &quot;Long-haulers&quot;). 60% of participants will receive Niagen and 40% will&#xD;
      receive PBO. Outcomes will consist of standardized cognitive, neuropsychiatric, physical,&#xD;
      functional and biomarker assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will recruit people who were infected with COVID-19 at least 2 months ago and&#xD;
      continue to experience symptoms related to infection. Initially thought to be an acute&#xD;
      illness like the flu, resulting in death for some or full recovery in most, we are now&#xD;
      appreciating that substantial numbers of COVID-19 illness survivors experience persistent,&#xD;
      significant and sometimes disabling symptoms. Variously called &quot;Long-COVID,&quot; &quot;COVID&#xD;
      long-haulers,&quot; or &quot;chronic COVID syndrome&quot;, some of the most prominent symptoms are&#xD;
      neurologic and neuropsychiatric, including cognitive impairment ('brain fog'), headache,&#xD;
      fatigue, muscle aches and weakness, shortness of breath, hair loss and pain, among others. In&#xD;
      this research study we want to learn about whether taking Niagen (also known as Nicotinamide&#xD;
      riboside, or NR), a daily supplement containing a form of Vitamin B3, can improve recovery of&#xD;
      cognitive function, mood, and physical health in individuals who were infected with COVID-19&#xD;
      and continue to experience &quot;brain fog&quot; and other neurological and physical symptoms. We think&#xD;
      that this supplement may help improve thinking skills and other symptoms, and improve quality&#xD;
      of life, in individuals who had COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the following at baseline and every 5 weeks: 1) a standard&#xD;
      cognitive battery and subjective cognitive complaints scales; 2) mood measures; 3)&#xD;
      assessments of physical functioning, as well as of other common Covid-19-related symptoms; 4)&#xD;
      blood draw; and 5) 2 optional MRIs. Participants will also wear a Fitbit and complete&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess sleep and physical activity.&#xD;
