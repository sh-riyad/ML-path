  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, prospective, placebo-controlled, comparative, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind local phase II clinical trial. Duration of study is 18 months. In the study,&#xD;
      patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1: 1 into two arms, standard medical therapy +&#xD;
      placebo versus standard medical therapy + inhaled Aviptadil arms. Randomization will be&#xD;
      carried out by the block randomization method. In the event that patients need intensive care&#xD;
      in the study, the patients will be taken into intensive care unit and excluded from the study&#xD;
      and their treatment will be continued in the intensive care unit as deemed appropriate by the&#xD;
      physician and it is foreseen that inhaled Aviptadil will be used for a period of minimum 7&#xD;
      and maximum 14 days. Aviptadil will be discontinued in patients who do not heal after 14&#xD;
      days. This study includes 8 visits, consisting of a total of 7 physical visits and 1 phone&#xD;
      follow-up visit. The study period will be 6 months for each patient. Patient recruitment is&#xD;
      planned to take 12 months. Study centers will be asked to use investigational products for&#xD;
      their patients who sign the informed consent form for 12 months. The study population will&#xD;
      consist of patients 18 years of age and older with COVID-19 pulmonary involvement and&#xD;
      hospitalized patients.&#xD;

    <description>Standard medical treatment, as deemed appropriate by physicians, is going to be according to the Turkish Republic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 INFECTION) ADULT PATIENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES published by the Ministry of Health, General Directorate of Public Health. The management of all additional complications and / or symptoms that develop in patients will be managed in the same way as specified in these guidelines. If these guidelines are changed by the Turkish Republic Ministry of Health General Directorate of Public Health, a protocol amendment will be planned. The necessary changes within the scope of urgent security measures will be reflected in the standard treatment in accordance with the necessary regulations.</description>

    <description>In addition to the standard medical treatment mentioned above, patients randomized to this arm will be given Inhaled Aviptadil 2 times a day, 30 minutes apart. Aviptadil treatment is aimed to be a minimum of 7 days and a maximum of 14 days. Aviptadil will be discontinued in patients who do not heal after 14 days. The dose of inhaled Aviptadil was determined by evaluating the results of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies.</description>

    <description>Aviptadil is the synthetic analogue of the Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP), a biologically active 28 amino acid natural peptide that is endogenously synthesized in humans. It is one of the signaling molecules of the neuroendocrine immune network and has vasodilator, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.</description>
