  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of the novel corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is rapidly&#xD;
      evolving. Although infections may be mild, up to 25% of all patients admitted to hospital&#xD;
      require admission to the intensive care unit, and as many as 40% will progress to develop&#xD;
      severe problems breathing due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS often&#xD;
      requires mechanical ventilation, with a 50% risk of mortality. Researchers at the Ottawa&#xD;
      Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) have been studying the potential therapeutic role of&#xD;
      mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, or MSCs, for the treatment of ARDS for over a decade. This&#xD;
      has led to the world's first clinical trial using MSC therapy for patients with severe&#xD;
      infections (sepsis) which is often associated with ARDS (NCT02421484). This trial&#xD;
      demonstrated tolerability, and potential signs of efficacy. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      have established expertise in producing clinical-grade MSCs and have received approval from&#xD;
      Health Canada for the use of MSCs in three different clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol consists of 2 sequential trials using the same trial infrastructure, noted as&#xD;
      the Phase 1 trial 'CIRCA-1901' and the Phase 2a trial 'CIRCA-1902'. CIRCA-1901 is an&#xD;
      open-label, dose-escalating and safety trial using a 3+3+3 design to determine the safety,&#xD;
      and maximum feasible tolerated dose of repeated delivery of Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal&#xD;
      Stromal Cells (UC-MSC) intravenously. The investigators will enroll up to 9 patients; each&#xD;
      receiving repeated unit doses of UC-MSCs delivered by IV infusion on each of 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days (24±4 hours apart) according to the following dose-escalation schedule (3 patients per&#xD;
      dose panel): (i) Panel 1: 25 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 75 million MSCs), (ii)&#xD;
      Panel 2: 50 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: 150 million MSCs), (iii) Panel 3: up to&#xD;
      90 million cells/unit dose (cumulative dose: up to 270 million MSCs). If no safety issues are&#xD;
      identified, we will continue to the Phase 2a trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIRCA-1902 is a single-arm, open-label extension of the CIRCA-1901 trial to assess early&#xD;
      signs of efficacy (major morbidity and mortality). The Phase 2a trial (CIRCA-1902) will&#xD;
      enroll 12 patients to assess early signals of benefit on mortality and major morbidity in a&#xD;
      high risk, high mortality population.&#xD;
