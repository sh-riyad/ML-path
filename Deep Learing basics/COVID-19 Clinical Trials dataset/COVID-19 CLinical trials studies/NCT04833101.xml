  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study, for evaluation of safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of sequential immunization of recombinant COVID-19 vaccine (adenovirus type-5&#xD;
      vector) and RBD-based protein subunit vaccine (ZF2001) against COVID-19 in Chinese healthy&#xD;
      population. 120 healthy subjects aged over 18 years of age who have been vaccinated with&#xD;
      recombinant adenovirus type-5 vectored vaccine will be recruited in this study. Of them, 60&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled in the &quot;0-28 days&quot; regimen and other 60 will be enrolled in &quot;0-56&#xD;
      days&quot; regimen. Subjects in each regimen will be randomly vaccinated with the boost dose of&#xD;
      subunit vaccine(ZF2001) against COVID-19 or a commercial influenza vaccine in a ratio of 2:1.&#xD;
      The occurrence of adverse events within 28 days and serious adverse events within 6 months&#xD;
      after vaccination will be observed. In addition, blood samples will be collected on the day 0&#xD;
      before and after the boost vaccination on day 14, 28 and 6 months after second vaccination to&#xD;
      test serum antibody levels and to profile the immune cells' subgroups and germlines. Each&#xD;
      subject will remain in this study for approximately 6 months.&#xD;
