      This mixed methods study evaluates the effectiveness and cost of a healthcare worker focused&#xD;

      In Aim 2, the investigators conduct a mixed methods study to evaluate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost of: (1) the healthcare worker focused outreach intervention strategy versus (2)&#xD;
      community organization led outreach working with community based organizations. The&#xD;
      investigators explore contextual factors (individual, family, and community) affecting&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing implementation outcomes and scalability. The primary outcome is uptake of&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing using the novel Rutgers Clinical Genomics Laboratory/RUCDR saliva test, the&#xD;
      first FDA authorized diagnostic test using saliva to detect SARS-CoV-2 for non-invasive, home&#xD;
      based self-testing. To compare participation rates in the two arms, our primary outcome, the&#xD;
      investigators will use data on the number of tests performed per month up to a 12 month study&#xD;
      period. For each intervention, the start time is the date of first attempted contact with&#xD;
      potential participants and the end date is either the end of the study period, or the date at&#xD;
      which the 1000th individual was tested (whichever comes first).&#xD;
