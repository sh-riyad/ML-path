  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stage A: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of red blood cells (RBCs) prepared with the&#xD;
      INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells Pathogen Reduction Treatment (PRT) in comparison&#xD;
      to conventional RBCs in patients who require RBC transfusion support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage B: To provide early access to the INTERCEPT pathogen reduction system for RBC in&#xD;
      regions where a substantial proportion of the population has been infected or is at risk of a&#xD;
      transfusion-transmissible infection, and the risk of asymptomatic infection among qualified&#xD;
      blood donors is recognized. Besides the reduction of risk of transfusion transmitted ZIKV,&#xD;
      the intent of the study is also to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections&#xD;
      (TTI) in general, including transfusion related sepsis and other emerging or concurrent&#xD;
      endemic pathogens (e.g., SARS-CoV-2, Dengue and Chikungunya), and to potentially reduce the&#xD;
      risk of TA-GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of this treatment use study, additional data will be provided on the safety of&#xD;
      INTERCEPT-treated RBCs (IBS RBCs) supplied for routine clinical transfusion practice.&#xD;

      Stage A&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized and transfused with study RBCs (Test or Control with 1:1&#xD;
      ratio) according to local practices for up to 28 days of transfusion support. Following the&#xD;
      28-day acute transfusion support period, patients will be transfused with conventional RBC&#xD;
      components as indicated by their treating physician unless they are enrolled in the optional&#xD;
      follow-up extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-bleeding patients at baseline requiring repeated RBC transfusion for congenital or&#xD;
      acquired chronic anemia (e.g., sickle anemia, thalassemia, other hemoglobinopathies,&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, chemotherapy or stem cell transplant etc.) will be&#xD;
      eligible to participate in an extension option for up to 6 months to evaluate patients&#xD;
      requiring repeated transfusion for chronic anemia. Subjects will receive the same study&#xD;
      article (Test or Control RBC) as assigned in the initial 28-day study period. Following&#xD;
      participation in the optional 6-month extended transfusion support period, patients will be&#xD;
      transfused with conventional RBC components as indicated by their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening/Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potentially eligible patients at participating institutions will be approached for study&#xD;
      consent. Subjects &lt;18 years of age will require subject assent and parental consent. For&#xD;
      subjects eligible for enrollment into the 6-month extension period option, consent/assent for&#xD;
      the extension period should be obtained at initial enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and undergo screening.&#xD;
      Screening data collection and procedures will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics (age, sex), vital signs, height, weight, indication for anticipated transfusion,&#xD;
      type of scheduled surgery (if applicable), medical and surgical history, transfusion history,&#xD;
      physical examination, comorbid conditions, concomitant medications, hematology panel&#xD;
      (including complete blood count), blood type and Rh, Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT), blood&#xD;
      chemistry, coagulation panel, Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT), immune reactivity to IBS RBCs,&#xD;
      pregnancy test (when applicable). Once all screening assessments are completed and&#xD;
      eligibility is confirmed, the subject may be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If results from the following assessments are available in the medical record within 30 days&#xD;
      prior to randomization, those data may serve as the screening data and the assessments do not&#xD;
      need to be repeated unless the subject has an RBC transfusion in the 30-day period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hematology panel (complete blood count), blood chemistry and coagulation panel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood type and Rh&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IAT, DAT, and immune reactivity to IBS RBCs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a RBC transfusion occurs after the study specific blood draws and assessments to determine&#xD;
      eligibility are taken but prior to randomization, the subject may be randomized and the tests&#xD;
      listed above should repeated prior to the first study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pregnancy test (when applicable) must be performed within 7 days of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Stage A, potentially eligible patients will be consented and begin screening in the study&#xD;
      in order to be considered for randomization. An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will&#xD;
      be used for electronic randomization of eligible patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be at a 1:1 ratio of Test: Control and stratified by site, baseline&#xD;
      bleeding status [indication for RBC transfusion due to active bleeding (WHO Grade 3 or 4,&#xD;
      APPENDIX 5) or for anemia without active bleeding], and non-bleeding patients' participation&#xD;
      of the optional extension period (yes/no). Anticipated surgical bleeding and planned blood&#xD;
      loss/replacement through red cell exchange at baseline should be included as active bleeding&#xD;
      (Grade ≥3) by definition. Randomized patients who do not receive any study RBC transfusions&#xD;
      through 28 days after randomization will be withdrawn from the study and replaced. Additional&#xD;
      data will not be collected for these patients. These subjects may be reassessed for&#xD;
      eligibility and re-enrollment after withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of screening, the patient's eligibility status will be entered into the electronic&#xD;
      data capture system (EDC). If eligible, the patient will be randomized. Only appropriate&#xD;
      blood bank staff will be able to access the treatment arm assignment. Study RBC unit labels&#xD;
      will be indistinguishable for Test and Control products. Medical staff, and others caring for&#xD;
      participating patients, as well as the sponsor (and delegates) will be blinded to treatment&#xD;
      assignment. Unblinded delegates will monitor the production of the RBC components at&#xD;
      designated blood centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage B has an open-label, single-arm design, hence no randomization or blinding procedures&#xD;
      are required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized patients will be transfused with Test or Control RBC components for up to 28 days&#xD;
      in the initial acute transfusion period and for an additional 6-months if the subject is&#xD;
      entered into the optional extension period. Subjects participating in Stage A's optional&#xD;
      extended study will continue to receive the same study article (Test or Control RBC) as in&#xD;
      their initial 28-day study period. An RBC transfusion episode is defined to include&#xD;
      consecutive RBC units transfused with ≤12 hours between transfusions (from the end of a prior&#xD;
      component transfused to the start of a subsequent component transfused). A confirmed negative&#xD;
      immune reaction to IBS RBC is required prior to the first study transfusion and at every time&#xD;
      point a Type/Rh and Screen (IAT) is performed for a patient within the 28-day acute&#xD;
      transfusion period or during the extension period. Compatibility for RBC antigens will be&#xD;
      confirmed using site's SOPs prior to transfusion of study RBCs. In case of confirmed&#xD;
      physiologically active antibodies to IBS RBC or any presumed or documented antibodies to IBS&#xD;
      RBC that preclude further transfusion with study RBCs, patients will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study treatment and supported with conventional RBC components and followed for safety.&#xD;
      Patients with antibodies to IBS RBC will be investigated for evidence of hemolysis and&#xD;
      continue with all planned visits and safety monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Transfusion Support Period (First study transfusion through Day 28 or death) and the&#xD;
      optional extension period (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The acute transfusion support period will comprise 28 days from the day of the first study&#xD;
      transfusion (Day 1) through Day 28, or death of a patient, plus an additional optional&#xD;
      6-month transfusion period for those patients entered into the extension period. During these&#xD;
      periods, patients will receive as many study RBCs as deemed appropriate by the treating&#xD;
      physician. All AEs, SAEs, TRs and unanticipated adverse device effects will be collected&#xD;
      starting from the initiation of the first study transfusion through 28 days after the last&#xD;
      study transfusion. The Investigators will assess each AE/SAE/TR and unanticipated adverse&#xD;
      device effects for relation to the transfused study RBCs. Transfusion reactions will be&#xD;
      classified by the definitions in the CDC NHSN Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol&#xD;
      (APPENDIX 1) and will be captured in the eCRF and, if in routine use, in the CDC NHSN&#xD;
      Biovigilance Component/Hemovigilance Module (www.cdc.gov/nhsn).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most proximate vital signs in the medical record will be collected prior to and following&#xD;
      each study transfusion. The subject's hemoglobin value will be collected from the medical&#xD;
      record, or if not available, a study sample will be submitted for testing, prior to and&#xD;
      following each study transfusion episode within 15 minutes to 24 hours after the end of the&#xD;
      transfusion episode and before the next RBC transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant concomitant medications taken during the study and blood products transfused will be&#xD;
      recorded with indication, total daily dose, and dates of drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the acute transfusion support period, patients will undergo the following assessments&#xD;
      prior to each transfusion episode: vital signs, AEs, TRs, SAEs and unanticipated adverse&#xD;
      device effects, comorbid conditions, blood samples for safety labs (complete blood count,&#xD;
      blood chemistry panel), IAT and immune reactivity to IBS RBCs. Samples may be used for&#xD;
      additional in vitro research tests as required to confirm transfusion-transmitted pathogen&#xD;
      mediated infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immune reactivity to IBS RBCs test will be performed and resulted each time an IAT is&#xD;
      performed within the 28-day acute and 6-month extension transfusion support period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Period (28 and 75 days after last study transfusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of the Day 28 (± 7 days) and Day 75 (± 15 days) follow-up visits, Day 1 of&#xD;
      the follow-up period is the day after the last study transfusion, either in the initial 28&#xD;
      day acute transfusion period or, if the subject is entered, in the optional extension period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 28 (± 7 days) After the Last Study Transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be collected, and blood samples will be collected for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Routine safety labs (complete blood count, blood chemistry panel, hematology panel, and&#xD;
           coagulation panel)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DAT and IAT&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immune reactivity test for IBS RBC&#xD;
&#xD;
      All AEs, SAEs, TRs and unanticipated adverse device effects will be reviewed and recorded for&#xD;
      the period from the first study transfusion through 28 days after the last study transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit (Day 75 ±15 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 75 (± 15 days) after the last study transfusion either in the initial 28 day acute&#xD;
      transfusion period or after the extension period, a blood sample will be collected for a DAT&#xD;
      and immune reactivity test for IBS RBC.&#xD;
