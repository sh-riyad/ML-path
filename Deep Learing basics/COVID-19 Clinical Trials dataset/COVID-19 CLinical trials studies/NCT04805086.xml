  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to a third of patients who recovered from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had a 20% decline in&#xD;
      lung function with a long term reduction in exercise capacity and SF-36 health status a year&#xD;
      after infection. Similar outcomes are now being reported in COVID-19 patients, with&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease (fibrosis) and long term lung function decline being a common&#xD;
      feature. Anti-fibrotic monocytes/macrophages are important for the clearance of partially&#xD;
      degraded collagen fragments of fibrotic extracellular matrix, in particular fibrillary-type&#xD;
      collagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MON002 is an autologous monocyte product, cultured in vitro prior to intravenous delivery&#xD;
      into patients with post-COVID-19 lung fibrosis.&#xD;

      The MONACO Cell Therapy Study is a prospective, non-randomised, open label study phase I/II&#xD;
      clinical trial with a key objective of evaluating safety of MON002 in 5 adults who have a&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (pulmonary fibrosis) after recovery from&#xD;
      acute COVID-19 infection. The main objectives of this study are to: (1) to determine the&#xD;
      safety profile of MON002 by assessing clinical responses in adults with post-COVID-19&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis and (2) to assess its impact on reducing disease morbidity/severity in&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
