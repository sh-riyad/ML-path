      The purpose of the You + ME Registry and Biobank is to collect clinical and patient-reported&#xD;
      data and biological samples (e.g. blood) from people living with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis&#xD;
      (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS), people with long-COVID and control&#xD;
      volunteers to improve understanding, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The You + ME Registry and Biobank is a collection of clinical and patient-reported data and&#xD;
      biological samples (e.g. blood) from people living with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (also known&#xD;
      as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS), people with long-COVID and control volunteers. The&#xD;
      patient registry collates demographic and real-world, longitudinal symptom, patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes, and treatment data from a global cohort into a centralized repository. The Registry&#xD;
      will also be linked to a biobank which is a place that stores tissues, blood or other samples&#xD;
      from participants. The combination of data and biological samples will be made available to&#xD;
      researchers so we can: (1) improve our understanding of the natural history, epidemiology,&#xD;
      pathogenesis, resilience/susceptibility factors, disease subsets, and treatment of ME/CFS and&#xD;
      long-COVID using a standardized set of demographic and longitudinal data; (2) build an&#xD;
      infrastructure and resource to support a range of future research into these diseases; (3)&#xD;
      increase opportunities for collaboration between patients, providers, researchers, and&#xD;
      industry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anyone 18 years of age and older is invited to sign up. After creating a profile and&#xD;
      completing an informed consent via an online portal, participants fill out a series of&#xD;
      surveys, including medical history, co-occurring conditions, symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      functional status, and treatments. Participants receive email reminders to complete follow-up&#xD;
      surveys to provide researchers with information about their health over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Registry also includes a mobile tracking app co-created with the community that allows&#xD;
      participants to monitor at minimum five core symptoms of fatigue, brain fog, unrefreshing&#xD;
      sleep, and orthostatic intolerance (on a scale of 0: symptom absent - 4: very severe) as well&#xD;
      as any additional symptoms of their choosing, life factors, and activity. Individuals can&#xD;
      also capture data in narrative form using a journaling function. Participants are encouraged&#xD;
      to capture data every 3 days if possible, but can track as often as daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry data is stored in a secure, encrypted database. Data is anonymized before being made&#xD;
      available on a secure platform for research. Biosamples collected from participants are&#xD;
      labeled with a coded number to protect their privacy and confidentiality.&#xD;
