  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill COVID-19 patients have a relatively high mortality rate (~30%). Most&#xD;
      critically ill COVID-19 patients require respiratory supports. The respiratory supports used&#xD;
      in this patient population included conventional oxygen therapy (COT) via nasal cannula or&#xD;
      face mask, non-invasive ventilation (NIV), and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). NIV has&#xD;
      three different methods, including high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), bilevel positive airway&#xD;
      pressure (BiPAP), and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). There are outstanding&#xD;
      questions that remain to be answered. One is which NIV is more effective; the other is if the&#xD;
      use of IMV leads to increased mortality. Another relevant question is if ventilator settings&#xD;
      (such as tidal volume, drive pressure, and positive end-expiratory pressure) are associated&#xD;
      with different mechanical ventilated patients' outcomes. To answer these questions, a&#xD;
      retrospective cohort study based on all patients who had been treated in the ICUs in Yale New&#xD;
      Haven Health System throughout the first pandemic year was designed.&#xD;

      Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous data are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) if it follows a normal&#xD;
      distribution assessed using histograms and Q-Q plots; otherwise, as median and interquartile&#xD;
      range (IQR). Categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages. Missing data will not&#xD;
      be imputed. Patients from a specific analysis were excluded if the data for the related&#xD;
      variable are missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective is to investigate the relative effectiveness of different NIVs, including&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and continuous&#xD;
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). Patients will be divided into three groups per the type of&#xD;
      NIV they first received. Patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) before&#xD;
      NIV will be excluded. Patients who received two or three different types of NIV will also be&#xD;
      excluded in this analysis. Patients who received IMV after the use of NIV are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to investigate the impact of IMV on mortality via comparison with&#xD;
      patients who received NIV only. The role of lung protective ventilation in patients who&#xD;
      received IMV will also be investigated. The characteristics of the ventilator settings that&#xD;
      are associated with an improved outcome will be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is in-hospital mortality and patients will be followed until hospital&#xD;
      discharge. Patients are considered alive if they were discharged alive from the hospital or&#xD;
      are still hospitalized at the closure of data extraction. For the first objective, the rate&#xD;
      of respiratory support escalation from NIV to IMV will also be analyzed (as a secondary&#xD;
      outcome measure in this analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be balanced using propensity score matching. The propensity score model will&#xD;
      include demographic characteristics, comorbidities, the pandemic phase, severity of acute&#xD;
      illness (24 hours before the targeted respiratory support), laboratory results (24 hours&#xD;
      before the targeted respiratory support), and vital signs (24 hours before the targeted&#xD;
      respiratory support). The balance between matched pairs will be assessed using a standardized&#xD;
      10% difference and calculated using the method described by Yang and Dalton. A stratified Cox&#xD;
      proportional-hazards model will be used to analyze the matched pairs. Additionally, survival&#xD;
      will be estimated using the product-limit Kaplan-Meier estimator, and the log-rank statistic&#xD;
      will be used to compare survival curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The backup statistical analysis plan is as follows. The univariate Cox proportional-hazard&#xD;
      models to screen for potential factors associated with lower mortality will be performed. A&#xD;
      multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model to estimate independent associations between&#xD;
      respiratory supports and mortality will be performed. The confounders included in the&#xD;
      multivariable analysis are as follows: 1) known risk factors for mortality (age, sex, and&#xD;
      hypertension); 2) the severity of the acute illness 24 hours before the targeted respiratory&#xD;
      support (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and Glasgow Coma Scale score); 3) the&#xD;
      various phases during the first pandemic year, including the first phase (February 1, 2020,&#xD;
      to May 31, 2020), the second phase (June 1, 2020, to August 31, 2020), the third phase&#xD;
      (September 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020), and the fourth phase (December 1, 2020, to last&#xD;
      date of data extraction); 4) the demographics and comorbidities with a P-value &lt; 0.25 in the&#xD;
      univariate analysis; and 5) the laboratory results and vital signs 24 hours before the&#xD;
      targeted respiratory support that have a P-value &lt; 0.25 in the univariate analysis. All&#xD;
      treatments considered to be part of COVID-19 management will be included in the multivariable&#xD;
      analysis for confounding control. To avoid collinearity, only one variable will be included&#xD;
      if two variables have an absolute Pearson's or Spearman's rank correlation coefficient&#xD;
      greater than 0.5. Variables with more than 10% missing data will also be excluded. Multiple&#xD;
      testing will be corrected using the Bonferroni method to reduce the chance of type I error at&#xD;
      a two-sided 0.05 alpha level, considering the hypotheses for all of the COVID-19-related&#xD;
      respiratory supports/treatments as a family. The association between exposures and mortality&#xD;
      will be estimated using hazard ratios (HRs) and reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&#xD;
      To account for clustering within hospitals, robust sandwich estimators to compute standard&#xD;
      errors for the HRs will be used. The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed using&#xD;
      Schoenfeld residuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a two-tailed hypothesis test, the significance level for each general hypothesis is&#xD;
      0.05. All analyses will be performed in R software (version 3.5.3, R Foundation for&#xD;
      Statistical Computing).&#xD;
