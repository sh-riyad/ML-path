    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed a rise in complicated appendicitis cases presenting&#xD;
      to our medical center. We collected objective data on all patients admitted to the surgical&#xD;
      department with appendicitis during February 2020 - March 2020 compared to the same 2 month&#xD;
      period in 2019, to understand the pandemic's affect on the rate of complications of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan and Hubei China during december&#xD;
      2019. On 30 January, WHO declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern&#xD;
      (PHEIC) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the number of cases worldwide stands stands at more than 76 million confirmed&#xD;
      cases according to the World Health Organization (WHO) records. First documented case in&#xD;
      Israel was reported on 21st of february 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the months of February and April, due to continued rise in confirmed cases, rigid&#xD;
      &quot;stay at home&quot; restrictions were issued. These restrictions have had a significant effect on&#xD;
      daily life. Under these new &quot;stay at home&quot; policies, many aspects of everyday life were&#xD;
      greatly diminished and restricted under threat of heavy fines. This effect also extends to&#xD;
      reduction in healthcare seeking. decline in emergency department (ED) visits was reported. A&#xD;
      drop in routine cancer screening appointments was reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delayed healthcare seeking also had an affect on the severity of various medical conditions&#xD;
      on presentation. fear of the COVID-19 pandemic may have resulted in delayed diagnosis, and&#xD;
      therefore higher complication rates in common medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      acute appendicitis (AA) is among the most common causes of lower abdominal pain leading&#xD;
      patients to attend the emergency department. As such, AA could serve as a good indicator for&#xD;
      the possible effect that the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic had on patients tendency for late&#xD;
      diagnosis and complication rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gomes Laparoscopic Grading System of AA, classifies appendicitis into five laparoscopic&#xD;
      grades according to gross morphologic findings during surgical laparoscopy. grades 1 and 2&#xD;
      regarded as non-complicated appendicitis, while grades 3, 4 and 5 regarded as complicated&#xD;
      appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we noticed a rise in&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis cases presenting to our medical center. We collected objective data&#xD;
      on all patients admitted to the surgical department with appendicitis during February 2020 -&#xD;
      March 2020 compared to the same 2 month period in 2019. Data such as the time period from&#xD;
      onset of symptoms to presenting to the ED, inflammatory markers, complicated appendicitis (if&#xD;
      any), type of complication, post operative complications. We aim to assess whether the &quot;stay&#xD;
      at home&quot; restrictions had any adverse effects on severity or outcomes of AA.&#xD;
