  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cellular Sciences Inc has submitted over 17 human clinicals (phase I, II, III including&#xD;
      animal safety data) to the FDA for the reduction of respiratory inflammation and inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines including IL-6 the cause of the cytokine storm in COVID patients. These clinicals&#xD;
      demonstrated a reduction of inflammation in all lung and sinus diseases, in patients with&#xD;
      COPD, Pulmonary fibrosis, CF, asthma, sinusitis , the flu and nasal inflammation and&#xD;
      congestion. Inhaled sodium pyruvate reduces inflammation, congestion and in our phase III&#xD;
      clinical study with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis patients we demonstrated statistically and&#xD;
      clinical significant increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (form 52% to 86%) and a&#xD;
      decrease in hypoxemia, and a reduction in coughing. Inhaled sodium pyruvate alleviated the&#xD;
      symptoms associated with COVID-19 patients in Pulmonary Fibrosis, and may be a solution to&#xD;
      the lingering COVID-19 symptoms in patients that had the COVID-19 infection for example long&#xD;
      haulers. In flu and COVID infected mice, nebulized sodium pyruvate decreased morbidity,&#xD;
      weight loss, inflammatory cytokines and decreased viral titers compared to placebo controls.&#xD;
      The study to be done at Missouri State University is titled ( Two week sub-chronic&#xD;
      double-blinded placebo controlled trial designed to determine if sodium pyruvate nasal spray&#xD;
      will reduce the symptoms, duration and replication of COVID-19 and influenza infections)&#xD;

      Inhibition of Viral Replication, Reduction of the &quot;Cytokine Storm&quot; and reduction of COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms- Potential Treatment and Preventative for COVID-19 and Flu&#xD;
&#xD;
      In numerous human clinical trials (17, phase I, II, III clinical trials) submitted to the&#xD;
      FDA, with Pulmonary Fibrosis, COPD and Cystic Fibrosis patients, inhaled sodium pyruvate&#xD;
      reduced nasal and lung inflammation and congestion by reducing inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      including the IL-6 cytokine that causes the so-called cytokine storm with no known adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Cellular Sciences received Orphan Drug Designations for Pulmonary Fibrosis and&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis. Mice studies conducted by Dr. Lupfer at Missouri State University&#xD;
      substantiated our finding by testing nebulized sodium pyruvate in flu (influenza A H1N1&#xD;
      virus) infected mice that decreased morbidity, weight loss, proinflammatory cytokines, and&#xD;
      decreased viral titers (virus numbers) compared to the Placebo Control. Additionally, treated&#xD;
      mice consumed more chow during infection indicating improved symptoms (same results reported&#xD;
      in a pilot mice COVID-19 study). There were notable improvements in pro-inflammatory cytokine&#xD;
      production (IL-1Î²) and lower virus titers (viral numbers) on days 7 post infection in mice&#xD;
      treated with Sodium pyruvate compared to the Placebo Control animals. As pyruvate acts on the&#xD;
      host immune response, metabolic pathways and not directly on the virus, our data demonstrate&#xD;
      that sodium pyruvate is a promising treatment option that is safe, effective, and unlikely to&#xD;
      elicit antiviral resistance. Furthermore, we have preliminary data that suggest it may work&#xD;
      similarly during other respiratory virus infections including COVID19/SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients,&#xD;
      inhaled sodium pyruvate, a Non-Steroidal Nasal Spray (N115) demonstrated a statistically and&#xD;
      clinically significant increase in FEV-1, SaO2, FVC, FEV-1/FVC ratios (from 52% to 86%), and&#xD;
      a statistically and clinically significant reduction in coughing, hypoxemia and a reduction&#xD;
      in nasal and lung inflammation. Inhaled sodium pyruvate alleviated the symptoms associated&#xD;
      with the COVID-19 infections in Patients with COPD and Pulmonary Fibrosis. Nasal Nitric Oxide&#xD;
      reduces the rate, duration and severity of viral infections in healthy young children and in&#xD;
      healthy adults from the Flu, Rhinovirus and Coronavirus. The literature has reported that&#xD;
      Nitric Oxide is elicited and inhibits viral replication in pigs infected with porcine&#xD;
      respiratory coronavirus. Additionally Nasal Nitric Oxide levels decreases from normal levels&#xD;
      found in healthy adults, in patients with asthma (87%), COPD (73%) CF (44%) and Primary&#xD;
      Ciliary Dyskinesia (7%). The rate of infections increases with decreasing levels of nasal&#xD;
      nitric oxide. Young children, 6-17 years of age, produce (142%) more nitric oxide than&#xD;
      healthy adults, which may explain their resistance to COVID-19. Recently, researchers&#xD;
      announced that a high percentage of COVID-19 infected patients that were hospitalized were&#xD;
      Diabetics or were Pre-Diabetic. The literature has reported that elevated levels of glucose&#xD;
      in patients with diabetes mellitus cause a deficiency in the production of nitric oxide by&#xD;
      blunting nitric oxide synthesis, which may explain their susceptibility to COVID-19. Sodium&#xD;
      pyruvate increases nitric oxide and is safe for use by Patients with Diabetes. The inhalation&#xD;
      of nasal sodium pyruvate increased the synthesis of nasal nitric oxide to normal levels in&#xD;
      patients with low levels of nitric oxide to increase all lung functions and decrease the rate&#xD;
      of infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical survey of 367 patients who took a nasal spray similar to EmphyCorp' s N115&#xD;
      formula, over a two-year period demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the&#xD;
      number, symptoms, and severity of seasonal flu respiratory tract infections. The number of&#xD;
      flu or colds was reduced by 70% in Children and approximately 52% in Pregnant Women, Patients&#xD;
      with Allergic Rhinitis, Diabetes, and Pulmonary Fibrosis. It has been used successfully by&#xD;
      over 2 million patients globally in over 200 hospitals during the past 5 years to treat nasal&#xD;
      and lung inflammation, congestion in Patients with COPD, Allergic Rhinitis, Pulmonary&#xD;
      Fibrosis, sinusitis, the flu and Cystic Fibrosis, with no adverse events reported. It has&#xD;
      been used by Children, Diabetics, and Hypertensives, with efficacy and with no known side&#xD;
      effects. It has even been shown to be safe for use by Pregnant Women, for whom steroids are&#xD;
      contraindicated as they increase the risk of low birth-weight babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proactive treatments with sodium pyruvate are not toxic and could be of benefit to children&#xD;
      that are afflicted by many respiratory viruses and as a potential treatment for COVID long&#xD;
      haulers.&#xD;
