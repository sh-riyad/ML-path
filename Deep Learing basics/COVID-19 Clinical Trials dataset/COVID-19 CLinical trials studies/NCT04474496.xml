    <textblock>
      Marshallese adults in the U.S. will complete an online or telephone survey. This survey will&#xD;
      collect data describing the impact of COVID-19 on Marshallese communities. Data collected&#xD;
      will help describe: 1) risk exposure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barriers&#xD;
      and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators&#xD;
      to COVID-19 testing when appropriate, and 5) self-care behaviors during COVID-19. Participant&#xD;
      inclusion criteria: 1) Self-reported Marshallese; 2) 18 years of age or older; 3) Live in the&#xD;
      Continental U.S. or Hawaii.&#xD;

      Background and Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is much we do not know about the differential effects of COVID-19, early data&#xD;
      shows that minority communities are disproportionally effected by the virus. There are many&#xD;
      factors that may increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 including: 1) community&#xD;
      spread because of lack of access to testing in low-income communities, 2) work environments&#xD;
      that may increase exposure, 3) more densely populated housing that reduces the ability to&#xD;
      social distance, 4) limited understanding of preventive measures due to literacy and language&#xD;
      barriers, 5) constrained financial resources to stay home and not work, and/or 6) lack of&#xD;
      trust in the health care system. The Marshallese are a Pacific Islander population&#xD;
      experiencing significant health disparities with some of the highest documented rates of type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) of any population in the world. Estimated T2DM rates among&#xD;
      Marshallese in the U.S. range from 25%-50%, much higher than the general U.S. population.&#xD;
      People with T2DM are more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications when&#xD;
      infected with COVID-19; however, those that manage their T2DM well are less likely to become&#xD;
      extremely ill from the virus. In order to reduce the disparities caused by COVID-19 and&#xD;
      ultimately compare the effectiveness of prevention interventions among the low-income&#xD;
      minority communities most effected by COVID-19, it is critical to understand minority&#xD;
      populations': 1) risk exposure, 2) knowledge of preventive recommendations, 3) barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations, 4) barriers and facilitators to&#xD;
      COVID-19 testing when appropriate, and self-care behaviors during COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Document COVID-19 risk exposure for Marshallese community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Document Marshallese community members' knowledge of preventive recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Document barriers and facilitators to implementing preventative recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Document Marshallese community members' barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing&#xD;
      when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Document self-care behaviors during COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Explore COVID-19 pandemic related barriers and facilitators to T2DM self-management&#xD;
      among Marshallese adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 7: Assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on T2DM self-management activities among&#xD;
      Marshallese adults with T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete an online or telephone survey. Up to 100 participants will also be&#xD;
      invited to complete an in-depth qualitative interview in addition to the survey (these&#xD;
      results are not presented here). Community-based recruitment for the online survey will be&#xD;
      conducted by posting an informational flyer on social media. The flyer will contain a link to&#xD;
      the study information sheet and survey documents. Study team members will also reach out to&#xD;
      study participants via phone or electronic mediums (e.g. email, text, or messenger). Study&#xD;
      staff will send potential participants a link to an electronic survey using REDcap. The&#xD;
      REDcap system will include electronic documentation of consent prior to completing the&#xD;
      survey. Access to study data will be limited to only those personnel who need it to complete&#xD;
      relevant job duties. All data, regardless of whether it is identifiable or not, will be&#xD;
      stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked room, or on a secure University of Arkansas for&#xD;
      Medical Sciences (UAMS) server that requires two-factor authentication.Each participant who&#xD;
      completes the survey will receive a $20 Walmart gift card as remuneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures/outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our survey will be based on CDC risk assessments and utilize the NIH funded COVID-19 items&#xD;
      that are part of the PhenX Toolkit, as well as other standardized survey items/scales. Those&#xD;
      participants with T2DM will be asked to complete questions pertaining to T2DM self-management&#xD;
      during COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the descriptive nature of the study aims, the analytic strategy will focus on&#xD;
      presenting results of item-level descriptive analyses, with an emphasis on frequencies and&#xD;
      proportions. There will be no attempt to impute missing responses for any items. For each&#xD;
      analysis, the number of included responses will be reported.&#xD;
