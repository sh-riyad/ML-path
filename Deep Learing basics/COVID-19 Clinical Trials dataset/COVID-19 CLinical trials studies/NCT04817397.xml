      1. ry outcome includes the correlation between lymphocyre /neurtophll ratio (LNR) and&#xD;
           mortality rate during hospital stay in the ICU admitted COVID 19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ry outcome(s) include the LNR and its correlation with ICU stay, the need for mechanical&#xD;
           ventilation, renal impairment.&#xD;

      In December 2019,the COVID-19 virus has been mainly breaking out in Wuhan in China as&#xD;
      pneumonia affecting patients . Common clinical features During hospitalization started to&#xD;
      appear including acute respiratory infection , inflammatory reaction , fever, pneumonia,&#xD;
      cough, fatigue , anosmia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient known suspected if he has a clinical picture of viral pneumonia, exposure&#xD;
      history, and radiographic findings [CT] or [MRI] chest consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia.&#xD;
      the gold standard and the Final diagnosis (PCR) positivity for the presence of coronavirus .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune response to respiratory infection causes neutrophils to collect inside the lung&#xD;
      especially the alveoli. Neutrophils aggregation may lead to collateral tissue damage and&#xD;
      cytotoxicity. According to Previous studies apoptosis of lymphocytes occurred due to the&#xD;
      release of anti-inflammatory cytokines resulting in lymphopenia. high levels of circulating&#xD;
      neutrophils have been demonstrated in COVID-19 patients(&#xD;
&#xD;
      A lot of literatures and studies have demonstrated the value of what is called neutrophil/&#xD;
      lymphocyte ratio (LNR) as a simple prognostic ratio correlated to morbidity and mortality. Up&#xD;
      to our knowledge, there is no study utilized such ratio in COVID-19 ICU admitted patients, so&#xD;
      that, this study has been built&#xD;
