  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Royal Hospital Chelsea (RHC) has provided a sheltered housing environment alongside&#xD;
      integrated health and social care and comradeship for British Army veterans since 1692,&#xD;
      following a decree by King Charles II to aid the &quot;relief of veterans broken by age and war&quot;&#xD;
      (RHC, 2018). Today approximately 300 In-Pensioners, known globally as 'Chelsea Pensioners'&#xD;
      live at RHC. They also have access to an on-site infirmary providing nursing or personal care&#xD;
      for up to 68 people (CQC, 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RHC is in central London (UK) and comprises of several historical buildings, protected by the&#xD;
      organisations Mission Statement to &quot;â€¦safeguard their historic home for the veterans of&#xD;
      tomorrow&quot;. In-Pensioner's must have served in the British Army as a non-commissioned officer&#xD;
      (or have served at least 12 years 'in the ranks' prior to becoming a commissioned officer),&#xD;
      be aged 65 or over, be free of any financial obligations to dependents, and at the time of&#xD;
      admission be able to live independently. Traditionally a male-only residence, RHC welcomed&#xD;
      its first female Army veteran in 2009.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an absence of evidence to support the impact of care delivery and the Chelsea&#xD;
      Pensioner experience, with the only evidence being RHC Annual and Care Quality Commission&#xD;
      (CQC) reports which focus on strategic and operational matters rather than the impact of the&#xD;
      wider social care or environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This lack of evidence presents a unique opportunity to evaluate RHC's current service&#xD;
      provision, inform future direction and address the hiatus in evidence-based research to&#xD;
      quantify the impact of its model of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research will seek to address two main aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To gain an understanding of the current Royal Hospital Chelsea (RHC) model of care by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Evidencing the influence the model of care has on In-Pensioner health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Understanding the influence the model of care has on wider social care provision&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reflecting on the contribution the environment has on the In-Pensioner experience,&#xD;
                their health outcomes, and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To inform future RHC care provision by:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mapping current services, future need and sustainability of the model&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Projecting findings to inform the growth of existing services for future&#xD;
                generations of ageing veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings will inform RHC strategic direction as it continues to deliver care provision to&#xD;
      current and future generations of veteran, identify the value of RHC interventions, and&#xD;
      explore any development of service provision in the form of potential outreach care. Further,&#xD;
      the findings will look to inform wider social care provision which may contribute to national&#xD;
      health and social care policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings of the study may be applicable to the wider care provision within similar&#xD;
      residential care establishments as they will seek to present service delivery findings from&#xD;
      both a staff (care provider) and resident (care recipient) perspective and evidence best&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings may contribute to national health and social care policy (UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key staff and Royal Hospital Chelsea 'In-Pensioner' residents will be interviewed for this&#xD;
      study. New In-Pensioner residents will be invited to complete two Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaires (one on arrival and one six months later).&#xD;
