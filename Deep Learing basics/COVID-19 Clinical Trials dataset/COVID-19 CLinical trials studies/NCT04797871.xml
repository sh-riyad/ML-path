  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 survivors commonly exhibit a marked extra-respiratory complication affecting the&#xD;
      cardiac (arrhythmias and myocardial injury), renal (acute kidney injury), gastrointestinal,&#xD;
      nervous (neuropathy, encephalopathy), endocrine and musculoskeletal (weakness, pain, and&#xD;
      fatigue) systems. In this context, several studies have found that resistance training&#xD;
      intervention promotes important health-related benefits, including cardiac function, compared&#xD;
      to aerobic exercise training. Other exercise adaptations include increased skeletal muscle&#xD;
      metabolism function, yet physio/psychological adaptations are known to be limited in COVID-19&#xD;
      survivors. Hence, given that resistance training intervention is implemented in a manner that&#xD;
      is tolerable to the individual patient, it may be a potential beneficiary &quot;personalized&quot;&#xD;
      rehabilitation treatment for patients with COVID-19 syndrome ambulatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;EXER-COVID Clinical Study&quot; project aims at determining the role of personalized exercise&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of post-COVID-19 syndrome ambulatory patients.&#xD;

      100 patients will be recruited and undergo baseline testing, including examination, immune&#xD;
      systems, biochemistry markers, ECG, DXA, metabolic/respiratory function, VO2max, muscular&#xD;
      fitness, lipidomic/inflammatory/oxidative markers and psychological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After baseline testing, participants will be randomly allocated into one group receiving&#xD;
      standard of care (control group) or a group performing personalized resistance training&#xD;
      intervention two times a week over a period of 6 weeks. The randomization procedure involves&#xD;
      a computer-generated block randomization schedule in a ratio of 1:1 stratified by an&#xD;
      independent person. Following the 8-week intervention period (with a 1-week washout period),&#xD;
      both groups will complete a series of follow-up tests (as baseline testing). A 12-week&#xD;
      follow-up experimental day is also planned in order to evaluate physio/psychological changes.&#xD;
