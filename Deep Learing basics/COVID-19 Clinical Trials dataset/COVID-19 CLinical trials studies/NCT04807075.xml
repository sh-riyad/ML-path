  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The corona virus disease (COVID) pandemic has highlighted the importance of rapid, readily&#xD;
      available screeners and diagnostics to identify infected individuals. Recent studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that portable electronic nose sensing devices can detect volatile organic&#xD;
      compounds (VOCs). These compounds are end products of human metabolism or of enteric bacteria&#xD;
      and are excreted through the skin or exhaled breath. Importantly, the sensing devices can be&#xD;
      adapted into a wearable device providing continuous monitoring. Our goal is to develop a&#xD;
      battery-free, electronic nose sensor to serve as a screener and detect VOC patterns&#xD;
      associated to patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 without being invasive.&#xD;

      Purpose. This study will assess the feasibility of using an electronic nose to detect signals&#xD;
      indicating infection with severe acute respiratory disress syndrome corona virus-2&#xD;
      )SARS-CoV-2). Five different prototypes of electronic nose will be used that would be&#xD;
      deployed differently: 1) a patch, 2) clipped to a garment neckline, 3) clipped to a garment&#xD;
      waistline, 4) resting on a bedside table, and 5) integrated into a facemask. Data will be&#xD;
      collected over a three day period to determine the quality of the smell-print signals&#xD;
      collected by the different deployment regimes. Eligibility. Subjects admitted to University&#xD;
      of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) with definite or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection will be&#xD;
      eligible. Subjects must have access to a smart phone and be well enough to engage in the&#xD;
      active data collection. The goal is to enroll 30 SARS-CoV-2 infected and 30 uninfected&#xD;
      individuals. Eligibility of controls will be extended to patients admitted to UNMC with other&#xD;
      respiratory problems including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation,&#xD;
      pneumonia and congestive heart failure if needed. Adults (19 years and older) are eligible.&#xD;
      Subjects with allergic reactions to components of the devices will be excluded. Interventions&#xD;
      and evaluations. Informed consent will be obtained remotely following which an app will be&#xD;
      downloaded to their phone. A kit will be delivered to the patients room containing the five&#xD;
      devices. The app will support: instruction on use of the devices, reminders to collect data&#xD;
      every 2 hours between 08:00 and 20:00, and access to study personnel for support as needed.&#xD;
      The app will transmit smell prints from the 5 devices to a secure cloud-based database. The&#xD;
      study coordinator will oversee subject education and deployment of the devices by&#xD;
      phone/facetime. Subjects will be instructed on use of the devices, which they will&#xD;
      self-deploy in positions that do not interfere with any medical equipment. The patch,&#xD;
      clip-ons and bedside sensor will be worn continuously from 08:00 to 20:00. The mask will be&#xD;
      placed for 5 minutes before each data collection, which will be timed by the phone app. The&#xD;
      mask can then be removed until the next data collection. Smell-print data will be collected&#xD;
      for three days. Following this, the devices will be replaced into the kit box and collected&#xD;
      by the nursing staff. Clinical data will be collected from the electronic health record.&#xD;
      Follow up. Following completion of the study, subjects will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      questionnaire on the experience and asked about their willingness to be contacted for further&#xD;
      interviews.&#xD;

    <description>nose smell-print. This is recorded as a set of impedances, one from each sensor filament. This results in an 8-dimensional vector that will be recorded for each subject. The vectors will then be related to diagnostic category (SARS-CoV-2 positive vs. negative). This will be determined separately for each of the sensor devices.</description>
