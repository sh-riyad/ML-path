      TELEstroke to CAre for STroke Patients at a Comprehensive Stroke Center (TELECAST-CSC) during&#xD;
      the COVID-19 pandemic is a prospective cohort study evaluating guideline-based acute ischemic&#xD;
      stroke care at a comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 global pandemic.&#xD;
      TELECAST-CSC compares two cohorts: the &quot;in-person phase&quot; (December 1, 2019-March 15, 2020),&#xD;
      when all inpatient stroke team care was delivered conventionally in-person and the&#xD;
      &quot;telestroke phase&quot; (March 16, 2020-June 29, 2020) when all inpatient stroke team care was&#xD;
      delivered exclusively via telestroke as part of our healthcare system's pandemic response. We&#xD;
      studied the following primarily clinical endpoints: diagnostic stroke evaluation, secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention, health screening and evaluation, stroke education, and stroke recurrence&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The SARS-Cov-2 virus originated in Wuhan China in 2019 and rapidly became a global pandemic.&#xD;
      Beyond the pandemic, stroke care is further impacted directly by COVID-19-induced systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response and coagulopathy which leads to increased risk of embolic stroke and&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States, the highest level of stroke care is provided to the most critically ill&#xD;
      stroke patients at comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs). Many CSCs also utilize telestroke to&#xD;
      deliver remote stroke care externally to partnering spoke hospitals without local stroke&#xD;
      expertise in order to improve time-sensitive, emergent stroke interventions such as&#xD;
      thrombolysis and thrombectomy. Conceptually, telestroke may also surmount pandemic-related&#xD;
      barriers to stroke care delivery internally at CSCs and workflows incorporating telestroke&#xD;
      have been adopted out of necessity. However, the efficacy of remote patient care via&#xD;
      telestroke for stroke patients hospitalized at CSCs remains unclear. The aim of the&#xD;
      TELECAST-CSC trial was to prospectively evaluate whether inpatient stroke specialist care&#xD;
      provided via telestroke was equivalent to stroke care provided in-person during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;

    <description>A 24-item global assessment of fundamental inpatient acute ischemic stroke care informed by 2019 AHA guidelines comprising 4 categories:&#xD;
Diagnostic evaluation: Neurologist evaluation, head CT or brain MRI, intracranial vascular imaging, cervical vascular imaging, LDL, HgA1C, troponin, EKG, telemetry, echocardiogram, and outpatient prolonged cardiac monitoring.&#xD;
Secondary prevention: antiplatelet, dual antiplatelet, anticoagulation, statin, anti-hypertensives, diabetes management, symptomatic carotid revascularization. .&#xD;
Health screening and evaluation: swallow evaluation, cognitive assessment, rehabilitation evaluation Stroke evaluation: tobacco cessation counseling, exercise/ lifestyle counseling, signs of stroke.&#xD;
Each subject will be assessed for completion of these metrics.&#xD;
