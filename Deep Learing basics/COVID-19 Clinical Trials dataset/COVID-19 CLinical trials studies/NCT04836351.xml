  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large proportion of persons who have had COVID-19 have reported persisted symptoms as&#xD;
      fatigue and dyspnea months post infection which affect activities of daily living.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to examine the feasibility and safety of a concentrated&#xD;
      rehabilitation program with a mobile application follow-up for persons with persistent&#xD;
      symptoms post COVID-19 infection. We will examine recruitment availability, adherence to the&#xD;
      program, goal achievement, and resources requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A feasibility study with one group pre-post test design with 10-20 persons between&#xD;
      18-67 years, with persistent symptoms post COVID-19 will be included. The intervention is 3+&#xD;
      1-2 days concentrated rehabilitation with a mobile application follow-up for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following assessments wil be used: Cardiopulmonary exercise testing, lung function,&#xD;
      functional performance tests, questionnaires regarding dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      work-status, health status, sleep behavior, physical activity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data before and after the intervention will be presented. Focus group interview&#xD;
      will be done with the participants. The interview will be analysed using systematic text&#xD;
      condensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a&#xD;
      pandemic, and a year later more than 120 000 000 people are confirmed with the disease. The&#xD;
      disease has caused more than 2 700 000 deaths globally. Norway has a low mortality rate&#xD;
      compared to rest of the world. However, a large proportion (10-33%) of the patients worldwide&#xD;
      have reported persistent symptoms, such as dyspnea, reduced exercise capacity, loss of&#xD;
      taste/smell and fatigue months after the infection. Persistent symptoms are also found in&#xD;
      younger populations and in persons with an initially mild disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will take place at &quot;Helse i Hardanger&quot; (HiH)(Health center in Hardanger,&#xD;
      Norway). The participants will stay for a 3 -day rehabilitation intervention, if needed,&#xD;
      another 1 or 2-day stay will be offered about a month later. The concentrated treatment will&#xD;
      be given by an interdisciplinary team, including doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists,&#xD;
      pharmacists, psychologists/psychiatrists, and nurses. The intervention is an individualized&#xD;
      group treatment based on behavioural change.&#xD;
