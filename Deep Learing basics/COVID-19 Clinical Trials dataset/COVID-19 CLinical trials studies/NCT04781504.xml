  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of premature death in Canadian women. Women&#xD;
      who suffer an acute coronary event are more likely than men to be physically inactive, have&#xD;
      lower exercise capacity, and die in the next year. The standard cardiac rehabilitation (CR)&#xD;
      programs do not meet women's needs. There is a need to address these issues to increase&#xD;
      participation in CR. The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise&#xD;
      training (MICE) on exercise capacity and quality of life in women with CHD. Positive results&#xD;
      of this study will fill the gap in knowledge in exercise training, levels of motivation,&#xD;
      self-efficacy and enjoyment following HIIT vs. MICE in women with CHD.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Exercise capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to week-6 and from baseline to week-12</time_frame>
    <description>will be measured using a gold standard symptom-limited, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on an electronically braked cycle ergometer. Gas exchange will be monitored continuously; the highest rate of oxygen uptake achieved (i.e. peak VO2 in mL/kg/min) during the last minute of the CPET will represent exercise capacity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>physical and mental health</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>physical and mental health will be measured using the Mental Health Composite Scale (MCS) and Physical Composite Scale (PCS) of the Short Form-36 questionnaire. It consists of 36 items that contribute to eight subscales summarized into a physical component summary scale (PCS) and a mental component summary scale (MCS). A higher score on a 0-100 scale indicates a better quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-specific Quality of Life, global health, physical and emotional health</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured using the HeartQoL, a validated 14-item questionnaire that assesses patients' feelings on how heart disease affects daily functioning, providing a global-health related QoL score and physical and emotional subscales. Higher score means better quality of life. Score range from 0-3, where higher scores represents better heart quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Scores range from 1-27 where higher scores means higher depression severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>changes in vital signs will be measured using resting blood pressure (mmHg) in a seated position after a 5-minute rest period on the right arm using an automated monitor (BPTru) that measures 6 times (the first will be discarded and an average of the last 5 measurements will be used for statistical analyses) at 2-minute intervals.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vital Signs</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>

    <measure>Self-determined motivation for exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to 12 weeks and baseline to 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>the 24-item Behavioural Regulation in Exercise questionnaire (BREQ-3) yields an overall Relative Autonomy Index (RAI) score, representing overall self-determined motivation. The scale ranges from -3 &quot;amotivation to +3 &quot;intrinsic regulation&quot;.</description>

    <description>the 9-item Multidimensional Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (MSES-R) yields an overall self-efficacy for exercise score reflecting scheduling, task and coping self-efficacy. The MSES consists of nine items on a 100% confidence scale ranging from 0 = &quot;no confidence&quot; to 100 = &quot;completely confident.&quot;</description>

    <description>the 18-item Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) measures the extent (on a 7-point Likert scale) to which participants enjoy doing physical activity. Overall enjoyment for physical activity score is determined by summing the items, with a range of 18-126 being possible. Higher scores indicate higher enjoyment.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Patient does not have internet connection;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unable to provide written informed consent; or&#xD;
