      An Open-Label Part is added:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part will enroll in selected sites which are less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 subjects with NASH and fibrosis confirmed by liver histology (F1-F3) will be randomized&#xD;
      into 3 groups according to the post-baseline biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Open-Label Part is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and PK of twice daily administration (BID) of Aramchol 300mg in&#xD;
           subjects with NASH and liver fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the kinetics of histological outcome measures and Non-Invasive Tests (NITs)&#xD;
           associated with NASH and fibrosis for the treatment duration of 24, 48 and 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be allocated to Aramchol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double Blind Part:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part is double blind, placebo controlled randomized in subjects with NASH and fibrosis&#xD;
      stages 2-3 who are overweight or obese and have prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this part of the study are to evaluate the effect of Aramchol as&#xD;
      compared to placebo on NASH resolution, fibrosis improvement and clinical outcomes related to&#xD;
      progression of liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to receive Aramchol 300mg BID or matching placebo in a 2:1&#xD;
      randomization ratio.&#xD;
