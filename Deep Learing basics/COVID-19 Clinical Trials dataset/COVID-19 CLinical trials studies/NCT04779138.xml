  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal seeks to enhance uptake and completion of COVID-19 vaccination among African&#xD;
      American and Latinx public housing residents in South Los Angeles. Given the multiple&#xD;
      disparities experienced by public housing residents, the investigators will utilize a&#xD;
      theoretically-based, multidisciplinary and culturally tailored intervention to provide&#xD;
      education at multiple levels and implement innovate strategies to engage this population in&#xD;
      the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One particular group, African American and Latinx public housing residents, are facing&#xD;
      adverse effects related to worsening social determinants and health disparities. Utilizing a&#xD;
      community-driven approach, the overall objective of this proposed study is to increase&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine uptake and completion the impact of COVID-19 among African American and&#xD;
      Latinx public housing residents. Guided by the Community Based Participatory Model, the&#xD;
      Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) and the Transtheoretical Model will be&#xD;
      utilized to carry out this intervention. Through this innovative program, we will establish&#xD;
      Academic-Community Team for Improving Vaccine Acceptability and Targeted Engagement&#xD;
      (ACTIVATE) program, which will develop leadership triads of public housing resident leaders,&#xD;
      nurse practitioner students, and public health students to carry out this multilevel&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>This is a pre-experimental &quot;one group pretest-posttest&quot; design to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake and completion among African American and Latinx public housing residents in South Los Angeles. The proposed intervention will employ (1) culturally sensitive, (2) theoretically based intervention that will be jointly delivered by our ACTIVATE triad leaders and our researchers. We will use the Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (IMB) model and the Transtheoretical Model to implement the intervention.</description>
