    <textblock>
      As it is evident that Covid-19 may have some impacts on cognition, the primary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate -if any- deficits of attention, working memory and executive&#xD;
      functions after Covid-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since Covid-19 (Coronavirus Disease-2019) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019, it is still widespread and deadly. As an ongoing&#xD;
      pandemic, it has led to a panic and then a controlled fear in societies. In many studies,&#xD;
      neuropsychological deficits were observed in Covid-19 patients both during the illness and&#xD;
      after recovery. A recent study found that impairment in cognitive functions continued after&#xD;
      recovery of Covid-19, and it was associated with peripherical inflammatory markers, such as&#xD;
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP). CRP, as a peripherical inflammatory marker, has been proven to be&#xD;
      inversely related to serum levels of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an&#xD;
      important neurotrophin in the growth and differentiation of neurons. In this study,&#xD;
      attention, working memory and executive functions of Covid-19 patients at post-covid period&#xD;
      and its relation with the severity of the disease will be investigated.&#xD;
