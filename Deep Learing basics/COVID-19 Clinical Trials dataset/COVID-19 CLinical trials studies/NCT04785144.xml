    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, randomized clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females,&#xD;
      18 years of age and older, who are in good health, have no known history of COVID-19 or&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, and meet all other eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351&#xD;
      manufactured by ModernaTX, Inc, given in vaccination schedules alone, sequentially, or&#xD;
      coadministered with mRNA-1273. mRNA-1273.351 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated&#xD;
      mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized S protein of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Enrollment will occur at approximately five domestic clinical&#xD;
      research sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes two cohorts. Cohort 1 will provide rapid information about the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 in a previously vaccinated group. This cohort can inform near&#xD;
      term public health decisions if the variant virus becomes more widespread. Cohort 2 will&#xD;
      evaluate different strategies for generation of cross protective immune responses in a naïve&#xD;
      population. This cohort will take longer to provide information on the immunogenicity of&#xD;
      mRNA-1273.351, but is important to inform future public health strategies. Cohort 1 will&#xD;
      include approximately 60 subjects 18 years of age and older who received two vaccinations of&#xD;
      mRNA-1273 at dosages of 50 mcg, 100 mcg, or 250 mcg in the Phase 1 clinical trial (DMID&#xD;
      20-0003). Subjects in Cohort 1 will receive a single intramuscular (IM) injection of the&#xD;
      designated vaccine and will be followed through 12 months after vaccination. Follow-up visits&#xD;
      will occur on Days 8, 15, and 29, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months after the vaccination.&#xD;
      Cohort 2 will include approximately 150 participants 18 through 55 years of age who have not&#xD;
      received a COVID-19 vaccine, have no known history of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection, and&#xD;
      do not have underlying conditions that are associated with an increased risk of severe&#xD;
      illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. They will be randomly assigned to one of 8 treatment arms&#xD;
      and will receive 2 or 3 IM injections of the vaccine and followed through 12 months after the&#xD;
      last vaccination. Follow-up visits will occur 7, 14, and 28 days after each vaccination, as&#xD;
      well as 3, 6 and 12 months post the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of mRNA-1273 and&#xD;
      mRNA-1273.351 vaccines, in naïve and previously vaccinated individuals.&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Cohort 1: Male or non-pregnant female, &gt;/= 18 years of age at time of enrollment.&#xD;
             Cohort 2: Male or non-pregnant female, 18 through 55 years of age at time of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Women of childbearing potential* must agree to practice abstinence or use at least one&#xD;
             acceptable primary form of contraception.**, *** Note: These criteria are applicable&#xD;
             to females in a heterosexual relationship and child-bearing potential (i.e., the&#xD;
             criteria do not apply to subjects in a same sex relationship).&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Not of childbearing potential - post-menopausal females (defined as having a history&#xD;
             of amenorrhea for at least one year) or a documented status as being surgically&#xD;
             sterile (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or&#xD;
             Essure(R) placement).&#xD;
&#xD;
             ** Acceptable forms of primary contraception include monogamous relationship with a&#xD;
             vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 180 days or more prior to the&#xD;
             subject's first vaccination, intrauterine devices, birth control pills, and&#xD;
             injectable/implantable/insertable hormonal birth control products.&#xD;
&#xD;
             *** Must use at least one acceptable primary form of contraception for at least 30&#xD;
             days prior to the first vaccination and at least one acceptable primary form of&#xD;
             contraception for 60 days after the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. In good health.*&#xD;
&#xD;
             * As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or&#xD;
             ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90&#xD;
             days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical&#xD;
             diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations,&#xD;
             emergency room, or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen). This&#xD;
             includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result&#xD;
             of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days before&#xD;
             enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider,&#xD;
             insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same class of&#xD;
             medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change&#xD;
             in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome or for dose&#xD;
             optimization, as determined by the participating site PI or appropriate&#xD;
             sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion.&#xD;
             Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to&#xD;
             subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate&#xD;
             a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent&#xD;
             to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not&#xD;
             precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no&#xD;
             anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of&#xD;
             responses to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Oral temperature is less than 100.0 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must agree to have samples stored for secondary research.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Agrees to adhere to Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Must agree to refrain from donating blood or plasma during the study (outside of this&#xD;
             study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Positive pregnancy test prior to each vaccine administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BMI &gt; 40.0 kg / m^2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Female subject who is breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has any medical disease or condition that, in the opinion of the participating site PI&#xD;
             or appropriate sub-investigator, precludes study participation.*&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Including acute, subacute, intermittent or chronic medical disease or condition that&#xD;
             would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of injury, render the subject unable&#xD;
             to meet the requirements of the protocol, or may interfere with the evaluation of&#xD;
             responses or the subject's successful completion of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of self-reported or medically documented significant medical or psychiatric&#xD;
             condition(s).*&#xD;
&#xD;
             * Significant medical or psychiatric conditions include but are not limited to:&#xD;
             Respiratory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], asthma)&#xD;
