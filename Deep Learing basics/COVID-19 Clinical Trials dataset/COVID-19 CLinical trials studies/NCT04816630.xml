  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential for MDW and other CPD parameters&#xD;
      (measured with CBC-DIFF) to identify COVID-19 diseased adult individuals presenting to the&#xD;
      hospital with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or respiratory infection and whose standard of&#xD;
      care includes CBC-DIFF and microbial testing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate MDW and/or combination(s) of hematology parameters&#xD;
      that best identify patients with COVID-19 disease who tested SAR-CoV-2 positive by standard&#xD;
      of care (SOC) COVID-19 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A feasibility study of consecutive adult patients who presented to the hospital with symptoms&#xD;
      suggestive of COVID-19 or respiratory infection and whose standard of care testing involves a&#xD;
      CBC-DIFF and microbial testing including RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 will be enrolled. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate MDW and other CPD parameters performance in COVID-19 patients and the&#xD;
      ability of MDW to identify RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients as well as potential added value&#xD;
      to RT-PCR tests of MDW. A minimum of 50 COVID-19 positive and 150 COVID-19 negative patients&#xD;
      meeting inclusion criteria will be evaluated. Patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19&#xD;
      and who have RT-PCR test samples drawn will be retested on the DxH900 hematology analyzer to&#xD;
      capture baseline MDW results. In addition, a retrospective data extraction will be performed&#xD;
      for those patient samples tested during the Post Market study during the COVID-19 pandemic&#xD;
      that meet the revised study population.&#xD;
