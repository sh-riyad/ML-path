  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease pandemic has been started in late 2019. Survivors of COVID-19 are&#xD;
      significantly more likely to develop clinical sequelae three months after discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital than those without COVID-19 infection. This is true not only for general and&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms but also for cardiovascular and psychosocial symptoms. This suggests&#xD;
      that these symptoms may indeed be the sequelae of recovery for COVID-19 survivors. So, we&#xD;
      aimed to detect the prevalence and to evaluate the type of symptoms that could persist after&#xD;
      the recovery from COVID19 infection in Sohag governorate, Egypt.&#xD;
