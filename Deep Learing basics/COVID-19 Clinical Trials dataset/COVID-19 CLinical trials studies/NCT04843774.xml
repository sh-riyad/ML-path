  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus and the causative&#xD;
      agent of COVID 19 disease, whose presentation symptoms range from asymptomatic infection to&#xD;
      mild flu-like symptoms to multi system failure and death, resulting in significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality worldwide. Novel vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus have very recently been&#xD;
      developed; however, the effectiveness, immune response, and short- or long-term safety of&#xD;
      these vaccines have not been tested in immunocompromised patients on anti-CD-20 therapy for&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (MS) or for other disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the immune response of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna messenger RNA&#xD;
      (mRNA)-platform vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2 virus given as standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
      in MS patients on ocrelizumab.&#xD;

                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing&#xD;
