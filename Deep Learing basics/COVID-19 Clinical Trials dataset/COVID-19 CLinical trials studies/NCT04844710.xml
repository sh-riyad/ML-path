  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a problem that is being faced in more than 200&#xD;
      countries in the world, including Indonesia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared&#xD;
      the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. The transmission of the virus occurred rapidly that 2&#xD;
      weeks from the first case diagnosed, 1000 patients tested positive. A week later, the number&#xD;
      of positive cases exceeded 4600, reaching more than 30,000 patients and 2,500 deaths on March&#xD;
      18, 2020. The death rate due to COVID-19 in Indonesia is one of the highest in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no therapy has been shown to be effective for Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). A vaccine&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 also has not been found at this time and is in the research phase. Current&#xD;
      management of COVID-19 patients focuses primarily on providing supportive care. Currently,&#xD;
      several countries make treatment guidelines for COVID-19 patients by providing several types&#xD;
      of anti-viral drugs and other drugs such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine,&#xD;
      immunoglobulins, anti-cytokine agents or immunomodulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The administration of these drugs does not escape the various side effects experienced by&#xD;
      patients. Administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine carries the risk of causing&#xD;
      prolonged QT interval which can lead to arrhytmia disturbances such as torsades des pointes&#xD;
      in certain people. Administration of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in combination with&#xD;
      azithromycin increases the risk of developing arrhythmias. Giving anti-viruses such as&#xD;
      lopinavir / ritonavir, umifenovir, remdesivir, favipiravir can also cause various side&#xD;
      effects including gastrointestinal disturbances (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), impaired liver&#xD;
      function, and hyperuricaemia. Treatment with human immunoglobulins has been associated with a&#xD;
      significantly increased risk of thrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no acupuncture research on COVID-19 patients has been published. However,&#xD;
      acupuncture can play a role in several conditions that occur in COVID-19 according to the&#xD;
      pathophysiology that occurs, this has been proven through several clinical studies conducted&#xD;
      on non-COVID-19 cases that have pathophysiology that resemble COVID-19 conditions. In&#xD;
      COVID-19 with mild-moderate symptoms, acupuncture can play a role in boosting the immune&#xD;
      system, including increasing the number of Natural Killer cells and lymphocytes. Whereas in&#xD;
      cases of severe COVID-19 symptoms, it is hoped that acupuncture can provide anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect and prevent cytokine storm.&#xD;
