  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As previously shown, individuals who experienced COVID-19 have developed some protective&#xD;
      immunity to reinfection. The magnitude and duration of protection from reinfection conferred&#xD;
      by the infection may be weaker after an asymptomatic infection as it is after a symptomatic&#xD;
      COVID-19 episode. Moreover, it is known that immunity decreases among older adults compared&#xD;
      to younger individuals often referred to as ''immune senescence,'' and leading to a decreased&#xD;
      efficacy of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study raises the question of whether a single administration of BNT162b2 in participants&#xD;
      with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to sufficient and durable immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to evaluate the level of the single BNT162b2 vaccine dose response according to&#xD;
      the severity of the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection in young and elderly participants with the&#xD;
      same immunogenicity analyses to assess this response in participants receiving the two-dose&#xD;
      vaccination regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national open phase II trial, assessing the immunogenicity and safety of vaccine&#xD;
      candidate Pfizer - BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 in participants with no history of SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection receiving two doses of vaccine and in participants with history SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection of more than 6 months and receiving only one dose of vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 volunteers will be included and vaccinated in 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Adults with no history of COVID 19 (N=150)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 1A: 18 - 45 years old: 50 volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 1B: 65 - 74 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 1C: At least 75 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Adults with history of COVID 19 of more than 6 months (N=150)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 2A: 18 - 45 years old: 50 volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 2B: 65 - 74 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sub-group 2C: At least 75 years old: 50 volunteers* (minimum of 45)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each subgroup of the group 2, a distribution will be respected including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/3 volunteers with asymptomatic COVID-19 infection,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/3 volunteers with mild COVID-19 infection (symptomatic but not hospitalized) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1/3 volunteers with severe COVID-19 infection (hospitalization required).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants within the group 1 will receive BNT162b2 (Comirnaty®) intramuscularly as a&#xD;
      2-dose series spaced 28 days apart at a dose of 30 µg each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants within the group 2 will receive BNT162b2 intramuscularly as a single dose of 30&#xD;
      µg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses of humorale and saliva immune responses will be performed in differents centralized&#xD;
      laboratories blinded for the trial group, by ELISA at Day -6/D0 (pre-vaccination sample),&#xD;
      D29, D57, M6, M12, and M24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T and B cell analyses will be performed in a sub-group of participants Immunosenescence will&#xD;
      be analysed in pre-vaccination samples.&#xD;
