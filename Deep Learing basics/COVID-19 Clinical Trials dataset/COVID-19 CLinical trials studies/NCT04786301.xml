  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      as acute respiratory infection with a history of fever ≥38°C and cough for less than 10 days&#xD;
      duration that requires hospital admission. SARI-PREP is a multi-center consortium funded by&#xD;
      the CDC Foundation being assembled with the goal of providing the infrastructure to rapidly&#xD;
      collect prospective data on clinical risks and outcomes, hospital-level stress, and biologic&#xD;
      specimens that will aid in the rapid development of diagnostic and treatment approaches. A&#xD;
      current example of a form of SARI to be targeted by SARI-PREP is COVID-19 the acute&#xD;
      respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 has a broad set of&#xD;
      manifestations and severity with a subset of affected patients developing severe disease&#xD;
      leading to respiratory failure and other forms of organ dysfunction. As with many outbreaks&#xD;
      of novel viral pathogens causing SARI there was no efficacious therapeutic intervention at&#xD;
      the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, while there is emerging knowledge of&#xD;
      clinical risks for severe COVID-19, there remains a paucity of information about the viral&#xD;
      dynamics and host responses that might indicate a patient is at high risk for poor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic will be the initial target of the SARI-PREP consortium with the overall&#xD;
      goal of developing a multi-institutional collaborative network of Acute Care Hospitals that&#xD;
      will rapidly enroll, sample, and follow patients admitted with severe COVID-19 and to develop&#xD;
      research protocols to rapidly determine demographic, clinical, host molecular, virologic, and&#xD;
      institutional correlates of outcome. Overall, the information gained from this effort will&#xD;
      help to rapidly inform and improve clinical management of epidemic/pandemic SARI patients.&#xD;
