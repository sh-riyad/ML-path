    <textblock>
      Chest computed tomography of patients having coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be analyzed&#xD;
      with regards to vascular abnormalities (pulmonary embolism and vascular thickening), and&#xD;
      their association with lung inflammation. The prevalence, severity, distribution, and&#xD;
      prognostic value of chest CT findings will be assessed. Patients with vascular abnormalities&#xD;
      will be compared to patients without, which is supposed to provide insights into the&#xD;
      prognostic role of such abnormalities, and the potential impact on treatment strategy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, computed tomography (CT) imaging has almost immediately&#xD;
      established itself as the primary non-invasive diagnostic tool for diagnosis, monitoring of&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia, and complications thereof.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While most of the currently available literature relies on non-contrast CT, the need to&#xD;
      assess vascular abnormalities is being recognized as an increasingly important factor, both&#xD;
      to help distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral infections, and to exclude pulmonary&#xD;
      embolism (PE). Acute PE is believed to be a significant contributory factor in patients with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relating to vascular changes other than PE, additional knowledge is required and not yet&#xD;
      available to confirm and better understand early observations. In particular, a radiological&#xD;
      sign referred to as &quot;vascular thickening&quot;, &quot;vascular enlargement&quot;, or &quot;vascular congestion&quot;&#xD;
      that is thought to be a specific marker of COVID-19 pneumonia, calls for a thorough&#xD;
      assessment. Quantitative analysis of this sign and correlation to clinical presentation is&#xD;
      highly desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multicentric observational study in the form of a registry.&#xD;
      For this purpose, each participating center needs to screen hundreds of COVID-19 patients to&#xD;
      select those who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any exclusion criteria. Then,&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory and imaging data of eligible patients will be retrieved. The research&#xD;
      will focus on the imaging manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia and their relationship to&#xD;
      vascular abnormalities within the lung; the potential association between such vascular&#xD;
      abnormalities and COVID-19 clinical severity will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve adequate statistical power, the study needs to be multicentric, involving 7 Swiss&#xD;
      institutions; CHUV Lausanne, USZ Zurich, USB Basel, Inselspital Bern, Division Stadt- und&#xD;
      Landspitäler Inselgruppe, HUG Genève, HRC Rennaz. The following investigators are involved in&#xD;
      this extensive nationwide effort:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHUV: Dr DC Rotzinger; Prof SD Qanadli; Prof PY Bochud; Prof L Alberio; Dr JL Pagani&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  USZ: Prof H Alkadhi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  USB: Prof J Bremerich; Dr A Sauter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inselspital: Prof T Heverhagen; Prof L Ebner&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Division Stadt- und Landspitäler Inselgruppe: Prof A Christe&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HUG: Prof A Poletti&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HRC: Prof O Ratib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrahospital medical records, laboratory tests results, and data from chest CT performed in&#xD;
      the participating centers between March 1st and July 31st, 2020 will be used to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assess the frequency of non-PE related vascular abnormalities on chest CT (vascular&#xD;
           thickening), and their association with parenchymal opacities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the rate of acute PE among the patients undergoing contrast-enhanced chest CT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quantify the clot burden in terms of proximal or distal obstruction and quantitative CT&#xD;
           obstruction index (CTOI) in patients with CT-proven PE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the consequence of PE on pulmonary perfusion (distinguishing perfused vs.&#xD;
           non-perfused pulmonary opacities) and cardiac morphology (right ventricle dilatation,&#xD;
           reduced left atrial size)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the correlation between pulmonary perfusion impairment and clinical severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using clinical, laboratory and CT imaging-derived variables, the investigators will perform&#xD;
      outcome modelling to derive an integrative score to predict outcomes.&#xD;
