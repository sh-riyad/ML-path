  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational study of COVID-19 surveillance and exposure testing in&#xD;
      school communities. Participating school communities are providing severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests to students and staff at their schools per school,&#xD;
      local, and national guidelines. This study will combine data received from the schools with&#xD;
      data collected directly from participants to guide analysis of the co-primary objectives.&#xD;
      Participants will be grouped into two different cohorts, depending on each school's&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 test administration practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveillance Cohort: Schools participating in this cohort will be performing surveillance&#xD;
      testing weekly on approximately 10-20% of students and 100% of staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure Cohort: Schools participating in this cohort will be performing exposure testing on&#xD;
      students and staff who have been identified as having close contact with school members&#xD;
      diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
