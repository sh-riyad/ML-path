  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ongoing SARS-CoV2 or Covid-19 pandemic is causing a major global health crisis. In&#xD;
      France, it prompted an urgent reorganization of the healthcare supply, mobilizing caregivers&#xD;
      and hospital staff in a climate of uncertainty. Health services have been put to the test,&#xD;
      some staff being on the front line, others having faced the reorganization of the health&#xD;
      system necessitated by such a pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontline caregivers have been compared to &quot;fighters on the front lines.&quot; They encountered&#xD;
      many difficulties, such as direct exposure to patients with a high viral load, exposure to&#xD;
      the risk of contamination, physical exhaustion, reorganization of workspaces, adaptation to&#xD;
      rigid work organizations, the management of the shortage of materials, the unusually high&#xD;
      number of deaths among patients, colleagues or relatives, ethical questions relating to&#xD;
      decision-making in a strained healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The psychological impact on these hospital staff is an indirect issue of such a pandemic in&#xD;
      terms of mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have little data in the literature on the incidence of psychiatric episodes&#xD;
      in the post-epidemic period. Work on the impact of two major pandemics of influenza A H1N1&#xD;
      (2009) and SARS-CoV-1 (2003) on the mental health of caregivers and other staff working in&#xD;
      hospitals reports increased rates of mental disorders after discharge from anxiety-type&#xD;
      crisis, depression and post-traumatic stress. This over-representation of mental disorders&#xD;
      was still found several years after the epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar results are emerging in recent studies involving hospital staff who were used in the&#xD;
      Covid-19 crisis. These highlight a certain number of risk factors for the occurrence of these&#xD;
      disorders (young age, nursing profession, underlying psychiatric pathology, exercise carried&#xD;
      out in the first line of Covid).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group (GHPSJ), a multidisciplinary working group was early&#xD;
      involved in psychological support for staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This group proposed the establishment of on-call duty entrusted to a psychological support&#xD;
      unit, made up of a doctor, a nurse and a psychologist who volunteered to carry out patrols in&#xD;
      the various departments of the hospital. These visits, sometimes organized at the request of&#xD;
      the management of the services and sometimes improvised, aimed to identify the difficulties&#xD;
      encountered in the field, and to discuss with the teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitantly and complementary, the staff bubble opened at the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital&#xD;
      on March 27, to offer a decompression space to all staff (caregivers or not) with proposals&#xD;
      for hypnosis, physiotherapy, sophrology sessions. , psychotherapy, but also informal&#xD;
      discussions or a break in a relaxing armchair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a continuation of this approach, the multidisciplinary working group plans to search in&#xD;
      July 2020 for symptoms present in certain mental illnesses (anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress syndrome) in all the staff of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group. ,&#xD;
      now that the crisis seems to be receding. This will make it possible to adapt the support&#xD;
      offer for staff in the coming months. This inventory will be made on the basis of validated&#xD;
      questionnaires: the Posttraumatic stress disorder CheckList-5 (PCL) questionnaire for&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) score for mental&#xD;
      disorders (anxiety, depression) . A 3rd questionnaire will collect additional data and&#xD;
      provide feedback on the frequentation of the bubble&#xD;
