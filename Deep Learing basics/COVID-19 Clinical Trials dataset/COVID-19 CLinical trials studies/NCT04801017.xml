      Primary Objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OT-101+Artemisinin when used in&#xD;
      combination with standard of care (SoC) in hospitalized COVID 19 subjects versus SoC+&#xD;
      Artemisinin+Placebo.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of OT-101+Artemisinin when used in combination with SoC in hospitalized&#xD;
      subjects with severe COVID 19. Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects or&#xD;
      their legally authorized representative (LAR) during screening (up to Day 3 prior to dosing)&#xD;
      and prior to study related procedures being performed. Following completion of all screening&#xD;
      assessments and meeting of eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled and randomized on&#xD;
      Day 1 to either receive OT-101+Artemisinin or placebo+Artemisinin in a 2:1 ratio for 7 days&#xD;
      in combination with SoC therapy per local SoC policies, followed to Day 28.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: includes subjects with severe COVID 19 (WHO COVID 19 Clinical Improvement Ordinal&#xD;
      Scale 5 - non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen, or 6 - intubation and mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo assessment during hospitalization or could discontinue their treatment&#xD;
      with OT 101 or placebo during the 7 day infusion period or any time later during the study.&#xD;
      All subjects will be closely monitored for adverse events (AEs) from signing the informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF) for at least 21 days after the final dose of study treatment (until Day&#xD;
      28). Standard of care treatment may continue as clinically indicated (after the 7 day dosing&#xD;
      completion) as per local institutional guidelines. If subjects are discharged after Day 7&#xD;
      (after completing dosing), post discharge assessments can be done either at home (home health&#xD;
      visit) or at the site. For subjects who are discharged before Day 28 or who withdraw from the&#xD;
      study early will have follow up phone calls or will be followed up at site or a home visit to&#xD;
      collect safety data until End of Study on Day 28. On days of laboratory assessments,&#xD;
      discharged subjects may have a home visit.&#xD;
