  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating global impact, and older adults who experience&#xD;
      it are at higher risk of death from the disease. However, survivors of the disease have a&#xD;
      greater risk of suffering from pathologies such as sarcopenia, which is more frequent in&#xD;
      younger adults and with greater severity of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is present in 5-13% of people between 60 and 70 years old and in 11-50% of the&#xD;
      population over 80 years of age. The diagnosis of sarcopenia has advanced in recent years by&#xD;
      establishing homogeneous criteria in different consensuses that necessarily combine two&#xD;
      elements: generalized loss of strength accompanied by loss of skeletal muscle mass. Today&#xD;
      there are three consensuses for the diagnosis of sarcopenia: the international (IWGS), the&#xD;
      European (EWGSOP), and the most recent from a US cohort (FNIH). In all of them, the&#xD;
      measurement of skeletal muscle mass constitutes one of the two diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main methods to measure this muscle loss that are established are imaging techniques&#xD;
      (computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) and ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common ultrasound measurements used for this purpose are the muscle thickness (cm)&#xD;
      at the point of the ultrasound path of maximum muscle thickness, the cross-sectional area&#xD;
      (area calculated by the basic software at the point of maximum muscle thickness), and the&#xD;
      pennation angle (angle formed between deep muscle fascia and muscle fibers). The first two&#xD;
      measurements can be made on several long muscles, while the pennation angle is usually made&#xD;
      primarily on the medial gastrocnemius (internal twin) muscle. They are easy to obtain,&#xD;
      bloodless, and reproducible measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research efforts at this point in the pandemic should focus on the longer-term consequences&#xD;
      of the disease, sequelae such as sarcopenia in patients who have suffered from COVID-19. At&#xD;
      the same time, clinicians must become increasingly aware of the condition and its measurement&#xD;
      integrated into clinical practice. The knowledge provided by studies such as the one&#xD;
      presented will allow the development of specific interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of sarcopenia should be considered when carrying out a risk / benefit assessment of&#xD;
      the established treatment (for example, dexamethasone), and considering a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      treatment that includes dietary inputs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients over 18 years of age who are admitted to the hospital and whose main diagnosis and&#xD;
      reason for staying is COVID-19 pneumonia will be included. The prevalence of sarcopenia in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients is 15-20%. Assuming an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.2 in a&#xD;
      unilateral contrast, 64 subjects are required to detect a difference equal to or greater than&#xD;
      20% loss of muscle mass. A loss to follow-up rate of 0% has been estimated.&#xD;
