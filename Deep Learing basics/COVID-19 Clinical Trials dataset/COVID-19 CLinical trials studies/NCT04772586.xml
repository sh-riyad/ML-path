  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SarcoV study aims at assessing the association between sarcopenia and the indication of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in older hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 infection&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is disease associated with poor clinical outcomes. In critical ill chirurgical&#xD;
      patients, sarcopenia is associated with difficult to wean of mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      association between sarcopenia and mechanical ventilation is poorly studied in medical&#xD;
      patients. COVID-19 pandemic has led a lot of medical patient to be admitted in intensive care&#xD;
      units due to acute respiratory failure with need of mechanical ventilation support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine if sarcopenia in critically-ill older patients with&#xD;
      COVID-19 is associated with the indication of mechanical ventilation. Secondarily, the study&#xD;
      aims at determining if sarcopenia is associated with difficult to wean and mortality in&#xD;
      critically-ill older patients with COVID-19.&#xD;

    <description>Association between probable sarcopenia and the indication of mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
Mechanical ventilation was considered by non-invasive ventilation or invasive ventilation. For purpose of analysis, it was defined as a binary outcome (yes(no).&#xD;
Probable sarcopenia probable was defined according to the revised European consensus on definition and diagnosis of sarcopenia (EWGSOP2). For purpose of analysis, it was defined as a binary condition (yes/no).</description>

    <description>Difficult to wean in mechanical ventilation is defined if the patient required more than 7 days of mechanical ventilation from the first spontaneous breath test or if the patient was reintubated within 48 hours after extubation. For purpose of analysis, it was considered as a binary outcome (yes/no)</description>
