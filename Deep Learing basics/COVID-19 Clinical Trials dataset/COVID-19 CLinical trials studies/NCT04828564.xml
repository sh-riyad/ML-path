    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase II/III trial that evaluates&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of favipiravir and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19 observed within 72 hours. Approximately 100 patients will be randomized in&#xD;
      1:1 ratio and divided into two groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical picture of COVID-19 disease is in a broad spectrum, which includes asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection, a mild upper respiratory tract infection, respiratory failure, and even severe&#xD;
      viral pneumonia with death. The alarming levels of spread and severity of COVID-19 caused a&#xD;
      global emergency and this outbreak has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronavirus entry into host cells is an important determinant of viral infectivity and&#xD;
      pathogenesis. SARS-CoV S1 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically&#xD;
      recognizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor. SARS-CoV spike needs to be&#xD;
      proteolytically activated at the S1/S2 boundary, such that S1 dissociates and S2 undergoes a&#xD;
      dramatic structural change. These SARS-CoV entry-activating proteases include cell surface&#xD;
      protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases cathepsins. These features of SARS-CoV entry&#xD;
      contribute to its rapid spread and severe symptoms and high fatality rates of infected&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin is a guanosine analog that interferes with the replication of RNA and DNA viruses.&#xD;
      Ribavirin was used during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in&#xD;
      combination with corticosteroids, which have an anti-inflammatory effect. Favipiravir is a&#xD;
      substrate for viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and showed anti-influenza virus&#xD;
      activity. Favipiravir is effective against other RNA viruses, poliovirus, rhinovirus, and&#xD;
      respiratory syncytial virus and evaluated and developed as a broad spectrum anti-RNA virus&#xD;
      drug, including lethal RNA virus infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to national guidelines, Favipiravir treatment is applied to COVID-19 infection in&#xD;
      Turkey. The main purpose of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety data for ribavirin&#xD;
      and favipiravir in the Turkish patient cohort diagnosed with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study designed as an open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, phase II/III&#xD;
      clinical drug trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in 4 sites.&#xD;
