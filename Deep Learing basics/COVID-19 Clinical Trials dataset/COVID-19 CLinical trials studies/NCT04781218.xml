  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ABC Registry is associated with Pro00107943 and provides a resource for collecting&#xD;
      information on members of school communities both regionally in North and South Carolina, as&#xD;
      well as nationally in the United States (U.S.) through the National Program, including&#xD;
      children, parents, teachers, superintendents, and other staff; and children identified&#xD;
      through clinical practice. The overall goals of the Registry are to collect data relevant to&#xD;
      public health during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to establish and engage&#xD;
      school communities that may be eligible for participation in future research studies,&#xD;
      including observational studies, as well as prospective COVID-19 trials.&#xD;
