      It is known that enhances wound healing by oxidative stress and supports immune system&#xD;
      besides it is cheap and has not any side effects. Aim of the study is to prevent pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis by using ozone therapy as a supportive therapy on the patients who have pneumonia&#xD;
      and ground glass opacity on thorax CT both in ICU and wards. Patients will follow for a year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients accepted with the diagnosis of pneumonia in Gaziosmanpaşa TREH, both in ICU and&#xD;
      wards have treated with additional ozone therapy beside the normal treathments. In these&#xD;
      patients the findings like ground glass opacity in thorax CT regarding to covid 19 were&#xD;
      progressed or non changed. In the concern of these opacities turn to pulmonary fibrosis,&#xD;
      ozone therapy has used to prevent this undesirable effect. It is known that enhances wound&#xD;
      healing by oxidative stress and supports immune system besides it is cheap and has not any&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 patients included this study. The patients were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia and&#xD;
      treated with ozone therapy in intensive care unit and ward. After treatment was done,&#xD;
      findings of at least %20-25 ground-glass opacity on thorax ct were the main criteria for&#xD;
      enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' follow-up program time after hospital discharge will be on 1st, 3rd, 6th and&#xD;
      12th month. They will continue to recieve ozon therapy once in a month during one year follow&#xD;
      up. Ground-glass opacity rate of thorax ct scan will be recorded as less then %25, %25-50,&#xD;
      %50-75 and above %75. Tomographies will be compared with each other and also last thorax ct&#xD;
      before hospital discharge. These tomographies will be applied under 80 KV and this will give&#xD;
      %40 less dosage according to routine 120 KV scans. If there is an increase in ground-glass&#xD;
      opacities compared to the previous one, the scan will be done again on prone position and&#xD;
      suspected lesions will be reevaluated. The pulmonary fibrosis findings of the scan will be&#xD;
      diagnosed by a well trained radiology doctor. The evaluation of dyspnea will also done during&#xD;
      follow-ups. mMRC(medical research council) dyspnea scale will be used for dyspnea status.&#xD;
      SpO2 values in room-air will also recorded. FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC values will also be&#xD;
      recorded to demonstrate respiratory functions.&#xD;
