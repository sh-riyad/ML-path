  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol focuses on the seroprevalence in primary care health care providers (PHCPs) in&#xD;
      Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHCPs manage the vast majority of COVID-19 and other patients and therefore are essential to&#xD;
      organize health care efficiently. Currently however, evidence is lacking on&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. how many PHCPs get infected or diseased in Belgium,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the rate at which this happens,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. their clinical spectrum,&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. their risk factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. the effectiveness of the measures to prevent this from happening and&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. the accuracy of the immunological serology-based point-of-care test in a primary care&#xD;
           setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be set up as a prospective cohort study. All Belgian GPs in clinical practice&#xD;
      will be invited to register online for participation in this national epidemiological study&#xD;
      and will be asked to invite the other PHCPs in their practice to do the same. A model and&#xD;
      demography-informed sample of registered GPs and other PHCPs will be selected. These&#xD;
      participants will be asked at each testing point to perform a capillary blood sample antibody&#xD;
      point of care test (OrientGeneÂ®) and complete an online questionnaire. All data analysis will&#xD;
      be performed and reported after each relevant testing period and at the end of the study.&#xD;

As reference standard the following testing algorithm will be use, i.e. serum samples will be tested first on the ELECSYS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), if the cut-off index (COI) is between 0.6-3.0 the sample will be tested on the ATELLICA IM SARS-CoV-2 assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and if discordant results it will be tested on the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy), using a two out of three 'reference standard'.</description>
