    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the performance of the NOWDx COVID-19 Test to an emergency&#xD;
      use authorized PCR test result. The intent is to show the rapid test device is comparable to&#xD;
      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay&#xD;
      intended for qualitative detection of total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in human fingerstick&#xD;
      whole blood at the Point of Care (POC); i.e. in patient care settings operating under a CLIA&#xD;
      Certificate of Waiver, Certificate of Compliance, or Certificate of Accreditation; and at&#xD;
      home.&#xD;

      a currently marketed device. The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is an in vitro lateral flow immunoassay&#xD;

      home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NOWDx COVID-19 Test is intended for use as an aid in identifying individuals with an&#xD;
      adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent or prior infection. At this time,&#xD;
      it is unknown for how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of&#xD;
      antibodies confers protective immunity. Testing of human fingerstick whole blood is intended&#xD;
      to be conducted in a home-like setting of a facility authorized to perform CLIA waived tests.&#xD;
