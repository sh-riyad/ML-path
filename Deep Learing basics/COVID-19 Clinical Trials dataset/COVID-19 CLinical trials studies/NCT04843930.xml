      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of AKL-T01, a&#xD;
      remotely-delivered digital cognitive intervention, relative to a waitlist control in&#xD;
      improving cognitive functioning in COVID-19 survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests a subgroup of survivors of COVID- 19 have residual difficulties&#xD;
      with cognition and daily functioning. These deficits are pronounced in cognitive domains&#xD;
      including attention, learning and executive skills, and may continue to impact quality of&#xD;
      life after recovery from other COVID-19 symptoms. This study aims to investigate the efficacy&#xD;
      of AKL-T01 (Akili Interactive), a remotely-delivered digital cognitive intervention, in&#xD;
      targeting and improving cognition and functional outcomes in individuals recovering from&#xD;
      COVID-19. The efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention will be measured relative to a waitlist&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a randomized clinical trial designed to compare efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention relative to a waitlist control in patients who were infected with COVID-19. Participants will be randomized to the AKL-T01 or a waitlist control. We will use a waitlist design; at the end of the intervention period, participants in the control group will have the option to receive the 6-week AKL-T01 intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants and care managers will be instructed not to reveal the group assignment to the member of the research team conducting assessments. Following the completion of recruitment, data analysts will be provided with the data for the arms simply labelled as &quot;Group A&quot; and &quot;Group B&quot; to avoid bias. These generic labels will be unmasked only after completion of all the planned statistical analyses described below. Participants in the waitlist control arm who begin the intervention at the end of the waitlist period will have different assessors for the initial 6-week control procedures and the subsequent 6-week intervention period so as to maintain the blind.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive function, as measured by the Digit Symbol Matching Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in cognitive function in the experimental group vs. controls, measured by score on the Digit Symbol Matching Task, a timed measure of attention and processing speed. Participants are asked to correctly match pairs of shapes and numbers. Scores exceeding the normative mean (mean = 65.79) reflect better task performance and scores below the normative mean reflect poorer performance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in daily functioning, as measured by the NeuroQOL Cognitive Function scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the NeuroQOL Cognitive Function scale in the experimental group vs. controls. The NeuroQOL Cognitive Function scale is a 28-item self-report measure of daily functioning. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (mean (SD) = 50.09 (10.23)), reflect better self-reported daily cognitive abilities, while lower scores, defined as those falling below the t-score mean of the normative sample, reflect poorer self-reported daily cognitive abilities.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Multiple Object Tracking test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Multiple Object Tracking task in the experimental group vs. controls This task measures sustained attention, cognitive control, and working memory, and requires participants to remember and track a set of target circles as they move around the screen, among a larger set of identical distractor circles. The primary outcome measure is the number of dots that a participant was able to track and identify successfully. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 56.94) reflect better performance, while lower scores reflect poorer task performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Digit Span Backwards test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Test My Brain (TMT) Digit Span Backwards task in the experimental group vs. controls. This task measures sustained attention and working memory. Participants are shown a series of numbers and asked to reproduce them in reverse order. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 5.98) reflect better performance, while lower scores reflect poorer task performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Simple Reaction Time test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Simple Reaction Time task in the experimental group vs. controls This task measures simple reaction time and psychomotor speed, and requires participants to press a key whenever a green square appears. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 31.71) reflect faster response times, while lower scores reflect slower response times.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Choice Reaction Time test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Choice Reaction Time task in the experimental group vs. controls This task measures processing speed and cognitive control, and requires participants to indicate the direction of an arrow that is a different color from the rest. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 11.49) reflect better performance, while lower scores reflect poorer performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Letter-Number Switching test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Letter-Number Switching task in the experimental group vs. controls This task measures sustained attention and set-shifting, and requires participants to switch between responses to letters and numbers. Lower scores, defined as those below the normative mean (M = 1.06) reflect better set-shifting performance, while higher scores reflect poorer set-shifting performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Gradual Onset Continuous Performance Test in the experimental group vs. controls This task measures sustained attention and response inhibition, and requires participants to respond to specific stimuli and ignore distractors.. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 67.97) reflect better performance, while lower scores reflect poorer performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cognitive performance, as measured by the Visual Paired Associates Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Post Treatment (6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in scores on the Visual Paired Associates Task in the experimental group vs. controls. This task measures visual memory, and requires participants to learn and identify iamge pairs. Higher scores, defined as those exceeding the normative mean (M = 10.53) reflect better performance, while lower scores reflect poorer performance.</description>
