  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Moderate-risk surgical patients have a very high incidence of early serious postoperative&#xD;
      complications (approximately 50% at Royal Adelaide Hospital, RAH). This affects patients'&#xD;
      wellbeing and produces a high rate of unplanned postoperative hospital re-admissions. This is&#xD;
      also costly, and patients unnecessarily fill approximately 4000 RAH bed days annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial of a new model of enhanced care after surgery (Advanced Recovery Room Care, 'ARRC')&#xD;
      demonstrated that complications were quickly identified and expertly addressed. Re-admission&#xD;
      days appeared to decrease by 80%. Business and economic analysis showed (i) patients can&#xD;
      expect 3 extra days at home, (ii) 4000 bed days can be freed annually, and (iii) better care&#xD;
      at lesser cost (technically, ICER = -$600/day at home). Freeing hospital beds, and rapid cost&#xD;
      savings, are critical in this Covid era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial re-introduces ARRC for Orthopaedic, Colorectal, Gynae-Oncology and Neurosurgery,&#xD;
      and other specialties, and formally examines patient outcomes and costs compared to eligible&#xD;
      patient who do not receive ARRC. Data from patient progress and vital signs are to be used to&#xD;
      improve patient risk stratification and triage at defined timepoints before, during, and&#xD;
      after surgery. This may allow better and earlier identification of patients (not) needing&#xD;
      ongoing ARRC, potentially reducing costs of care further without affecting safety. A Markov&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness model provides the platform for cost effectiveness outcomes (Days at Home&#xD;
      V Cost).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The problem: Surgery is essential for approximately 1/3 of healthcare needs, and its volume&#xD;
      needs to double out to 2040. However, it has risks, with serious postoperative complications&#xD;
      occurring frequently (5%-30% of patients) and postoperative death being the third most&#xD;
      prevalent cause of death globally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications result in increased patient suffering and mortality, late adverse events such&#xD;
      as re-admission, and two to three-fold increases in resource use (cost). They can be&#xD;
      considered 'the hidden pandemic' of modern healthcare and, because of an ageing comorbid&#xD;
      population, are estimated to increase by 300% in Australia by 2027.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Australian National Summit on Postoperative Complications (March 2020), chaired by G&#xD;
      Ludbrook, acknowledged the importance of this problem. Its report identified the need for a&#xD;
      Systems approach, with an evidence base, clear pathways of care matched to individual&#xD;
      patients' risks and needs, techniques to minimize unnecessary practice variation, and&#xD;
      relevant performance measures: outcomes (institution- and consumer-centred) and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One solution: In 2017, an Advanced Recovery Room Care model (ARRC) was trialled at RAH. This&#xD;
      utilized all the Summit Systems elements and Principles - early validated risk assessment&#xD;
      (NSQIP), triage of moderate-risk patients (predicted 30-day mortality: 1-4%) to mid-level&#xD;
      high-acuity postoperative care overnight (ARRC), appropriate staff and capacity, precise&#xD;
      regular checklist-based assessment, specific physiological goals, repeated re-assessment and&#xD;
      re-triage, formal handovers, and evaluation with relevant metrics. This trial revealed that:&#xD;
      early serious adverse events were unexpectedly common (50% of patients); these mainly&#xD;
      occurred for 12-18 hours postoperatively; and re-admissions were very common (34%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduced complications and sequelae: ARRC resulted in fewer ward-based complications; and an&#xD;
      80% reduction in hospital re-admission days, p=0.1. A 10-bed unit should free up 4000 RAH bed&#xD;
      days annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, ARRC findings align with (i) UK findings in moderate-risk patients - removing high&#xD;
      acuity care increased mortality and in-hospital days, (ii) RAH Health Roundtable data -&#xD;
      moderate-risk patient groups with unplanned re-admission rates of 35%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Iterative better risk prediction and triage: The data also suggested that by formal repeated&#xD;
      re-evaluation of risk over time (in theatre and ARRC), based on adverse events and&#xD;
      physiological parameters, the 50% of patients unlikely to have subsequent major complications&#xD;
      can be identified, and triaged to lower-acuity ARRC care, further reducing costs. This aligns&#xD;
      with RAH data showing early Recovery adverse events as a major predictor of subsequent&#xD;
      postoperative complications, and large databases associating pre-operative, in-theatre and&#xD;
      post-operative events with delayed complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness: Critically, ARRC appears cost-effective. Markov modelling of the ARRC&#xD;
      data reveal improved outcome (Days at Home) and costs, with an Incremental Cost Effectiveness&#xD;
      Ratio (ICER) of -$600. This aligns with Peter McCallum Cancer Centre's finding $1M annual&#xD;
      savings from implementation of a 2-bed unit (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis is that ARRC, through rapid detection and management of early serious&#xD;
      postoperative adverse events, will reduce subsequent complications, thus increasing patient&#xD;
      Days-at-Home at 30 and 90 days (DAH30/90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypotheses are: (i) that ARRC will be cost-effective, producing a negative&#xD;
      Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) when compared to conventional treatment, and (ii)&#xD;
      that continuous re-evaluation of individual patient risk during surgery and ARRC will allow&#xD;
      accurate identification of the lower risk sub-group of patients unlikely to have adverse&#xD;
      events overnight, allowing care to be downscaled earlier, this incrementally reducing cost&#xD;
      and improving ICER.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective unblinded pragmatic trial of ARRC versus conventional care. CALHN has&#xD;
      committed to re-starting ARRC, but excellent data are required to confirm efficacy on&#xD;
      outcomes and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort: Patients are moderate-risk patients (NSQIP-predicted 30-day mortality = 0.7-5%)&#xD;
      undergoing elective or emergency Colorectal, Orthopaedic, Gynae-Oncology, Neurosurgery, and&#xD;
      other surgeries over time, and scheduled for postoperative ward care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      System of Care: NSQIP risk is calculated early (elective surgery - outpatients; unscheduled&#xD;
      surgery - on admission), to quantify risks and highlight and address modifiable risks.&#xD;
      Allocation to conventional care or ARRC is pragmatically based on bed availability, thereby&#xD;
      producing minimal selection bias in the ARRC pilot and the observational UK study by Swart et&#xD;
      al. Intraoperative management will be consistent, guideline-based care, something&#xD;
      successfully implemented at RAH previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARRC will be the system piloted at RAH, located in close to the Recovery Room (PACU).&#xD;
      Critical elements include regular checklist-based assessment, and defined physiological&#xD;
      goals. ARRC involves multidisciplinary staff - anaesthesia, nursing, surgery, internal&#xD;
      medicine, allied health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This system includes all Summit report-recommended Principles for excellent high-value care,&#xD;
      and its Implementation recommendations that one institution take the lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Enabled throughout the perioperative journey by our EMR and our&#xD;
      Theatre/Recovery e-record system (AIMS) and managed by the PARC Clinical Research staff who&#xD;
      ran the ARRC pilot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are an extension of the pilot. In brief, this includes: (i) Preoperatively: patient&#xD;
      demographics / comorbidities; (ii) Intraoperatively: surgery type/duration, complications,&#xD;
      vitals sign variation, adverse events. Advanced monitors (ANI antinociception, continuous&#xD;
      blood pressure monitoring) aid development of the risk prediction algorithms, (iii) ARRC:&#xD;
      vital signs, adverse events, checklist completion, MET-level events (iv) post-ARRC: ward&#xD;
      adverse events, ICU transfers, re-operation, length of stay, re-admissions, days-at-home (30&#xD;
      and 90 days). Costs are from RAH Finance - ARRC, ICU, Ward, ED (re-admissions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Primary hypothesis: U Adelaide statisticians, who managed the ARRC pilot, will&#xD;
      use linear regression to find the mean difference in days-at-home (DAH) at 30/90 days between&#xD;
      the case and control groups. Power analysis from the ARRC pilot, conservatively assuming a&#xD;
      DAH difference of 1.5 days, suggests a sample size of N=876 cases and N=438 controls&#xD;
      (weighting 2:1). Interim analyses will be conducted to assess progress. Based on 16&#xD;
      patients/week, study duration is to be 82 weeks. With positive outcome trends, we expect ARRC&#xD;
      will expand to 32 patients/week, potentially reducing study duration to 61 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness: The CIA will update the Markov model transition probabilities and ICER as&#xD;
      data emerge. Sensitivity analysis determines uncertainty. Interim analysis will also be&#xD;
      conducted at the half-way point. Lower costs emerging from better risk prediction (e.g. lower&#xD;
      ARRC nursing ratios, earlier transfers from ARRC to the ward) will be incorporated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved risk prediction: U Southampton Clinical Informatics Unit colleagues will use their&#xD;
      ALEA platform. Predictive analytics expertise will be utilised to generate a hierarchical set&#xD;
      of novel predictive algorithms (based on available data inputs categories) and start to&#xD;
      create real-time clinical risk prediction dashboards. RAH data may ultimately be added to&#xD;
      other pilot sites worldwide.&#xD;
