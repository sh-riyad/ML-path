  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to disrupt memory reconsolidation have held promise for the treatment of&#xD;
      stress- and anxiety-related disorders. In the present study, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      whether an intervention based on these principles, called memory updating, could be adapted&#xD;
      for reward-seeking behaviors. To test this, non-treatment seeking tobacco smokers will be&#xD;
      exposed to smoking cues and/or stress, two stimuli known to trigger smoking. It is predicted&#xD;
      that exposure to a stress task will enhance the cues' motivational salience and yield greater&#xD;
      susceptibility to the memory updating procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an add-on, the investigators will examine COVID-associated changes in substance use and&#xD;
      whether participants in the memory updating groups might be more resilient to these effects.&#xD;
      It is predicted that the changes in substance use will depend on whether the substances are&#xD;
      used primarily in social settings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-treatment seeking cigarette dependent smokers will be randomized to one of four testing&#xD;
      conditions: 1) a non-stressful task followed by neutral cues, 2) the non-stressful task&#xD;
      followed by smoking cues, 3) a stressful task followed by neutral cues, or 4) the stressful&#xD;
      task followed by smoking cues. Ten minutes after the intervention, participants will undergo&#xD;
      a 60-minute extinction procedure consisting of smoking-related videos, images and smoking&#xD;
      paraphernalia. Cue reactivity test sessions will take place 24 hours, 2 weeks and 6 weeks&#xD;
      following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-associated changes in substance use will be quantified over three telephone interviews:&#xD;
      one at the end of March / beginning of April 2020 (at the start of the pandemic), one at the&#xD;
      end of April / beginning of May, and a final one which will be instituted if feasible once&#xD;
      the infection rates and social distancing policies have decreased.&#xD;
