  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic, a small minority of children have been presenting to acute&#xD;
      paediatric services with a new syndrome, Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome&#xD;
      temporally associated with SARS-Cov-2 (PIMS-TS). Children with PIMS-TS present with symptoms&#xD;
      of inflammation caused by the immune system going into overdrive - this is likely to be in&#xD;
      response to the virus. More severe cases involve inflammation and damage to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this project is to identify children with milder forms of PIMS-TS who are at&#xD;
      risk of progression to more severe disease. Being able to predict the disease course of&#xD;
      PIMS-TS at an early stage is important as it will allow clinicians to decide which patients&#xD;
      should be treated with immunosuppressants, which have been shown to reduce the severity of&#xD;
      the illness but have side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early data suggests that children with PIMS-TS have elevated biomarkers associated with an&#xD;
      over-reaction of the body's immune system (also known as a 'cytokine storm') reaction. This&#xD;
      study will explore whether children presenting with milder PIMS-TS have elevated 'cytokine&#xD;
      storm' blood profiles and whether these profiles differ between children who continue to have&#xD;
      a mild disease course compared to those who develop severe disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the COVID-19 pandemic a minority of children have presented to acute services with&#xD;
      clinical features of a new syndrome known as Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome&#xD;
      temporally associated with SARS-Cov-2 (PIMS-TS). This high inflammatory state, likely&#xD;
      triggered by the virus, has overlapping features of Kawasaki's and Toxic Shock Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus of this study is to identify which children presenting with mild PIMS-TS symptoms&#xD;
      will go on to develop severe disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. This is&#xD;
      important as data suggests that early aggressive treatment with immunosuppression can lead to&#xD;
      a relatively quick resolution in symptoms. The results of this study could allow clinicians&#xD;
      to be selective in treating patients in whom the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early data suggests a 'cytokine storm' is involved in the PIMS-TS disease process. This&#xD;
      proposed observational study will investigate whether children presenting to the non-ICU&#xD;
      setting with features of PIMS-TS have raised cytokine storm biomarkers and whether these may&#xD;
      be used to predict which children go onto develop severe disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will include up to 15 hospitals across East of England. NHS clinical care&#xD;
      teams will identify patients meeting the inclusion criteria and upload anonymised data into a&#xD;
      secure web-based study database. Data will be retrieved for retrospective cases from 1st&#xD;
      March 2020 and prospective data entered up until September 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred children presenting to acute (non-ICU) paediatric services with symptoms of&#xD;
      PIMS-TS during the study period will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to describe the 'cytokine storm' biomarker profiles of&#xD;
      children aged between 3 months to 16 years presenting with PIMS-TS to the non-ICU setting,&#xD;
      focussing on those biomarkers which are readily accessible to district general hospitals&#xD;
      (Pro-Beta Natriuretic peptide [BNP], ferritin, and CRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare cytokine storm biomarker profiles of children who have a mild disease course to&#xD;
           those who develop severe disease to identify whether there are any differences between&#xD;
           these groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the association between cytokine storm biomarker profiles and severe events&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare i) demographic characteristics (including pre-existing disease), and ii) other&#xD;
           routine clinical investigations of children who have a mild disease course and those who&#xD;
           develop severe disease to identify any differences between these 2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate the association between vaccination status and disease severity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Compare cytokine storm biomarker profiles of children testing positive and those testing&#xD;
           negative for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR on 2x nasopharyngeal swabs to identify any differences&#xD;
           between these 2 groups.&#xD;
