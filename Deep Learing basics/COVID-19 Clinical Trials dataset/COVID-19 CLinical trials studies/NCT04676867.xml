  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the time to sustained clinical resolution of symptoms of COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained clinical resolution is defined as occurring when no key COVID-19 related symptom has a score higher than 1 over a 72-hour period (as documented using an electronic patient-reported outcome [ePRO] instrument or paper based equivalent), except for sense of smell and taste where the score should be 0 over a 72-hour period. The time to resolution will be taken as the time from randomization until the first day of the last 72 hour period where the patient meets the definition of resolution within 28 days. Patients who do not meet the definition of resolution 28 days after randomization will be considered not resolved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Complete Clinical Resolution</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Time to complete clinical resolution is defined as occurring when all Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) related symptoms have resolved to a score of 0 over a 72-hour period (as documented using an electronic patient-reported outcome [ePRO] instrument or paper based equivalent). The time to resolution will be taken as the time from randomization until the first day of the last 72 hour period where the patient meets the definition of resolution within 28 days. Patients who do not meet the definition of resolution 28 days after randomization will be considered not resolved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) Symptom Severity Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (Day -2 to Day -1) up to 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>COVID-19 total symptom severity score will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for each visit as well as for changes from baseline (N, mean, standard error, confidence interval (CI)). A Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be performed to analyze the average difference between treatment groups over 28 days and at the designated assessment days.&#xD;
The scale is &quot;Assessment of 14 Common COVID-19-Related Symptoms: Items and Response&quot; from Table 1 in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) document, &quot;Assessing COVID-19-Related Symptoms in Outpatient Adult and Adolescent Subjects in Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biological Products for COVID-19 Prevention or Treatment Guidance for Industry&quot;. The symptoms are scored as on a scale of 0 to 3 for 12 of the symptoms where 0 is none and on a scale of 0 to 2 for the two other symptoms where 0 is &quot;as usual&quot;. A higher score is a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scoring of World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Outcome Scale (9-point Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (Day -2 to Day -1), Days 1, 3, 5, 10, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The number and percentage of patients for each WHO clinical outcome score will be summarized. An ordinal logistic regression analysis for the specified time points will be presented as odds ratio, with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value.&#xD;
This scale is called the &quot;WHO Clinical Outcome Scale&quot;. It is scored from 0 to 9 where 9 is the most severe disease presentation. A higher score is a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Hospitalization Through Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of this endpoint will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The number and percentage of patients who were hospitalized and reason for hospitalized will be presented. The percentage of patients who were hospitalized will be compared using a logistic regression analysis for specified time points. The results will be presented as odds ratios, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Progression to Oxygen Therapy Through Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of this endpoint will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The number and percentage of patients who progress to oxygen therapy and type of oxygen therapy will be presented. The percentage of patients who had progressed to oxygen therapy will be compared using a logistic regression analysis for specified time points. The results will be presented as odds ratios, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Hospitalization</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 thru to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The duration of hospitalization will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Duration of hospitalization will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, standard error, confidence interval (CI), minimum, and maximum). Linear regression will be performed to analyze the difference between treatment groups. The results will be presented as mean treatment difference with associated 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mortality Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of this endpoint will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The number and percentage of patients who died and reason for death will be presented. The percentage of patients who died will be compared using a logistic regression analysis for specified time points. The results will be presented as odds ratios, with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values.</description>

    <measure>Time to Viral Clearance Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The time to viral clearance based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Time to viral clearance will be summarized by treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methods. Median and associated 95% confidence interval (CI), 25-75 percentiles, and minimum and maximum values will be presented. The number and percentage of patients who do not show virus, show virus, and patients censored will be presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in log10 Viral Load</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening/Baseline (Day -2 to Day -1), Day 1, Day 3, Day 5, Day 7, Day 10, and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline in log10 viral load will be assessed at specified time points by a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM). Patients who have achieved a level below the limit of detection will be included in the analysis at half the lower limit of detection. For this endpoint, Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) will be used to impute values for all patients. The treatment effect for the difference at each time point, and the average slope up to each time point for each treatment group will be presented along with a 95% confidence interval (CI).</description>
