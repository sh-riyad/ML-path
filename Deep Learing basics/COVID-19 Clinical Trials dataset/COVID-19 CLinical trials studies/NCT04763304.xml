  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiologists and other professionals are at high risk of viral infection during&#xD;
      aerosol-generating procedures. Knowledge of the protective quality of PPE suits and the risk&#xD;
      of self-contamination after removal is paramount. This trial used an ultraviolet-fluorescent&#xD;
      solution to explore differences in self-contamination after removal of gown PPE (PPE-G) and&#xD;
      coverall PPE (PPE-C). A two-period/two-intervention (AB/BA) design was chosen; each&#xD;
      intervention consisted of audio-guided placement of PPE, full-body spraying of fluorescent&#xD;
      solution, audio-guided removal of PPE, and assessment of self-contamination through&#xD;
      ultraviolet light scanning. The primary outcome was the mean within-participant difference&#xD;
      (traces of any size) between PPE suits. Statistical significance was tested using t test for&#xD;
      paired data.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Crossover Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>We designed a prospective, randomized, controlled crossover trial with a total of 60 healthy anesthesia personnel volunteers. A two-period/two-intervention (AB/BA) design was chosen for this trial in order to estimate differences between both PPE suits with greater precision, given there is no participant variation between groups. The primary outcome was within-participant variability. A potential carryover effect was not expected considering the combination of an active (wet wipe cleansing) and passive (15 minute interval) washout period between interventions. All participants were randomly allocated to either intervention sequence: PPE-G (personal protective equipment including a gown for body protection) followed by PPE-C (personal protective equipment including a coverall for body protection) or PPE-C followed by PPE-G. Both interventions took place on the same day.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>In a specific area, the blinded outcome assessor (researcher #2) performed standardized scanning of participants' skin and base clothing using ultraviolet light in a dark room, revealing the presence of any fluorescent traces. The seven body zones assessed were face, anterior and posterior neck, arms, hands, clothing (anterior/posterior, upper, and lower clothing), and foot covers. Fluorescent traces were measured (small traces, â‰¤1 cm; large traces, &gt;1 cm) and quantified for statistical analyses.</masking_description>
