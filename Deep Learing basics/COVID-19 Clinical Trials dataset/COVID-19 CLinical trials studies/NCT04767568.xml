  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and the second in women with&#xD;
      an incidence of 43,350 new cases in 2018. This incidence is increasing every year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection is crucial in this pathology. In France, free screening is organized by&#xD;
      health insurance for people aged 50 to 74 years. This screening is based on an immunological&#xD;
      test (FIT: Fecal Immunological test), which aims to detect the presence of blood in the&#xD;
      stool. In fact, some polyps or cancers cause bleeding that is often minimal and therefore&#xD;
      difficult or even impossible to detect with the naked eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this test is positive, a colonoscopy is done to check whether or not abnormalities are&#xD;
      present in the colon or rectum. Performed under anesthesia, this examination can detect the&#xD;
      possible presence of polyps or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, with the covid-19 epidemic, the investigators were faced with an extension of the&#xD;
      delays for colonoscopies which led to delays in patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To prevent this, they propose to develop a blood test that would allow rapid identification&#xD;
      of patients with colorectal cancer, requiring rapid management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This blood test will permit to have a parameter for stratifying the therapeutic care in the&#xD;
      event of epidemia or situation that constrains the organisation of the health system.&#xD;
