  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory exercise training and aerobic exercise training will be given to patients who&#xD;
      have been hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID 19 and underwent IMV, who were&#xD;
      hospitalized in the service and underwent NIMV or high-flow oxygen inhalation, and whose&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms persist after discharge. The patients in the study group will be called&#xD;
      by phone once a week and a motivating conversation will be made. No control will be made to&#xD;
      the control group. Before and after the training, 6-minute walking test, MRC dyspnea scale,&#xD;
      SGRQ quality of life questionnaire and hospital anxiety depression scale will be applied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some of the patients with COVID 19 pneumonia still have respiratory symptoms despite being&#xD;
      treated. It has been reported that pulmonary rehabilitation programs applied in various&#xD;
      models and in a small number to relieve or reduce these symptoms reduce dyspnea, increase&#xD;
      exercise capacity and improve quality of life. There is no study reporting the results of a&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation program applied to COVID 19 patients in our country. The main&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation applied by&#xD;
      telecoach to patients with severe COVID 19 pneumonia or persistent respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
      Secondly, it is aimed to present the data of Turkish society to the literature. In accordance&#xD;
      with this purpose investigators planed a randomised control clinical study. In our study&#xD;
      respiratory exercise training and aerobic exercise training will be given to patients who&#xD;
      have been hospitalized in intensive care due to COVID 19 and underwent IMV, who were&#xD;
      hospitalized in the service and underwent NIMV or high-flow oxygen inhalation, and whose&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms persist after discharge. The patients in the study group will be called&#xD;
      by phone once a week and a motivating conversation will be made. No control will be made to&#xD;
      the control group. Before and after the training, 6-minute walking test, MRC dyspnea scale,&#xD;
      SGRQ quality of life questionnaire and hospital anxiety depression scale will be applied.&#xD;

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD); The HADS questionnaire has seven items each for depression and anxiety subscales. Scoring for each item ranges from zero to three, with three denoting highest anxiety or depression level. A total subscale score of &gt;8 points out of a possible 21 denotes considerable symptoms of anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>They will be given breathing exercise training and will be asked to do it every day for 8 weeks. In addition to breathing exercises, the use of incentive spirometry and aerobic exercise training will be provided. They will be asked to do breathing exercises, use of incentive spirometry and strengthening exercises for at least 20 minutes every day and 5 times a week. They will be called by phone once a week and encouraging speeches will be made.</description>
