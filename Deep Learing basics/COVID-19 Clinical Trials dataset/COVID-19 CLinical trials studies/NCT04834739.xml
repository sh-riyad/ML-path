      This study aimed to investigate if the functional capacity of health workers sustained covid&#xD;
      19 infection effects functional capacity , quality of life and mood of health workers when&#xD;

      This study was designed in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Service of Gaziosmanpasa&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital between January 4 and June 30, 2021.Data of the health workers&#xD;
      from our hospital who suffered from Covid-19 disease and matched control group who had not&#xD;
      have Covid-19 disease participants were analyzed. Participants signed a general consent&#xD;
      .Inclusion criteria; being a health worker over the age of 18 (for both groups), having had&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) disease for last 1 month and completed the isolation process, volunteer&#xD;
      to participate in the study, , being able to walk or sit and stand without any help, speaking&#xD;
      and understand Turkish language. Exclusion criteria (for both study and control group);&#xD;
      Neurological or musculoskeletal disease that causes gait impairment, cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      having unstable cardiac, respiratory and metabolic disease.(The first assessment will be made&#xD;
      within the 1st month after the patient's Covid 19 positivity is detected; control will be&#xD;
      made three times in the 2nd, 4th and 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 volunteer healthcare workers who had Covid-19 were included to study group. 30 age and&#xD;
      gender matched volunteer healthcare workers were included to control group. Healthcare&#xD;
      workers who have had Covid-19 disease will be evaluated for the first time within 1 month&#xD;
      after their diagnosis with RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom questioning will be reported including the initial symptoms of Covid-19 and ongoing&#xD;
      complaints of the patients. During the examination, muscle strength will be evaluated by the&#xD;
      Medical Research Council (MRC) total score. Resting heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (by pulse oxymeter) measurement will be applied to both groups before and after&#xD;
      the following tests: 1-min sit-to-stand (1MSTS) test, 5 times sit-to-stand (5TSTS) test, 6&#xD;
      minutes walk test (6MWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRC dyspnea scale will be performed as a measure of patient's complaint of shortness of&#xD;
      breath,Job performance was assessed by asking &quot;How do you evaluate your job performance?&quot; on&#xD;
      6-point Likert scale, Short Form-12 (Short Form 12, SF-12) will be used to assess quality of&#xD;
      life, mood disorder wil be measured by Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory,&#xD;
      Fatigue severity scale(FSS) will be performed as level of fatigue. The first evaluation wil&#xD;
      be made within 1 month after one positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is detected; control&#xD;
      evaluations will be made in the 2nd, 4th and 6th months after positivity of RT-PCR test for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the patient's sex, age, body mass index (BMI), height, education status,&#xD;
      career, status of hospitalization, length of hospitalization, comorbidities , pulmonary&#xD;
      involvement that diagnosed radiological methods and examination of symptoms related with&#xD;
      Covid-19 will be recorded.&#xD;

    <description>The 5XSST scoring is based on the amount of time (to the nearest decimal in seconds) a patient is able to transfer from a seated to a standing position and back to sitting five times. The equipment need in performing 5XSST test includes: Stopwatch and standard height chair with straight back (43-45 cm, 17-18 inches high). Then the instruction is given by asking the test taker to sit on the chair by resting their back. Also, the test taker is instructed to fold their arms across their chest. Then the test taker should be instructed to do sit-to-stand five times, as quickly as possible, at the count of go and without their back or leg resting on the chair between the interval of repetition.</description>
