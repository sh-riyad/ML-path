  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with rare diseases, during COVID-19 outbreak, have been highly burdened with anxiety,&#xD;
      loneliness, and depression. The project aims to evaluate resilience and coping strategies to&#xD;
      address pandemic impact by discussion in dedicated focus group using web-based platform. The&#xD;
      goal is to improve the coping skills and psychological well-being of children, adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults affected by rare skeletal diseases in a sustainable manner. If successful,&#xD;
      these interventions could be introduced into treatment procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      March 11th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic&#xD;
      accordingly with the spread and size of the infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The restrictions implemented by the governments have substantially changed people's&#xD;
      lifestyles, facilitating the emergence of emotions such as fear, anxiety, and a sense of&#xD;
      loneliness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The age groups most involved by these burdens have been childhood, adolescence, and young&#xD;
      adults. These groups have experienced dramatic changes in their daily life in order the&#xD;
      relational, educational, and social networks. Nonetheless, these links outline the ideal&#xD;
      environment for the development of resilience and the promotion of coping strategies to face&#xD;
      traumatic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These lifestyle challenges and their consequences are even more evident in the context of the&#xD;
      rare diseases since the outbreak containment measures have emphasized the troubles with which&#xD;
      people affected by these conditions are daily forced to confront, in terms of access to care&#xD;
      and treatments, resulting in increased stress and anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current phase represents a sensitive step for the resumption of the activities in charge&#xD;
      of the health and social service aimed at the citizens and especially to people with special&#xD;
      needs, such as people suffering from rare diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pandemic experience has promoted new forms of meeting and contact between individuals&#xD;
      using web-based platforms, playing a fundamental role in preserving the social and&#xD;
      &quot;sociality&quot; dimensions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, the rare diseases could be an attractive model since the pandemic impinges&#xD;
      over their bio-psycho-social characteristics at different levels. They could configure as an&#xD;
      exemplum of the resilience and coping strategies that could use to face the psychological&#xD;
      distress resulting from anti-pandemic measures, suggesting new approaches of taking in&#xD;
      charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate resilience and coping strategies to address pandemic impact by&#xD;
      discussion in dedicated focus group using web-based platform. The goal is to improve the&#xD;
      coping skills and psychological well-being of children, adolescents and young adults affected&#xD;
      by rare skeletal diseases in a sustainable manner.&#xD;
