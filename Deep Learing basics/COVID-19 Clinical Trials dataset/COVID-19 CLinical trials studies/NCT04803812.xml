  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In light of the coronavirus pandemic, the challenge of physician burnout has taken on a new&#xD;
      urgency. Long-hours and difficult, sometimes unsafe work conditions are creating a severe&#xD;
      strain for emergency physicians and others on the frontlines of Ontario's response to&#xD;
      COVID-19. There are a variety of evidence-informed ways that physicians can protect their&#xD;
      wellbeing with modest investments of time and energy that will be applied. The evaluation&#xD;
      will be a randomized trial comparing the outcomes from each of the three treatment arms.&#xD;
      Researchers may also use a pre-post comparison with control parameters to conduct an&#xD;
      exploratory analysis to assess efficacy.&#xD;
