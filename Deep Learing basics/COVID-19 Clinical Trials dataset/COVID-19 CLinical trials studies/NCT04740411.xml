  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are evaluating the effects of an online single-session mental health intervention (the&#xD;
      Common Elements Toolbox; COMET). To evaluate COMET, we are conducting a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial with college students attending American universities. Students will be randomized to&#xD;
      the COMET condition or to a wait-list control condition.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective Well-being questionnaire. Total scores range from 7 to 35. Higher values indicate higher well-being scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in items from the PERMA Profiler (positive emotion and negative emotion subscales).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Well-being questionnaire with questions related to positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, accomplishment, negative emotion, and health. Scores on each item range from 0 to 5. Lower scores indicate less well-being. We are using a shortened version of this questionnaire with 12 items. We have also modified the items to ask participants about their experiences over the past 48 hours. We predict that our intervention will produce changes in the positive emotion and negative emotion subscales. Each subscale consists of 3 items.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratings on the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring the acceptability of an intervention. Acceptability refers to the perception that a given treatment is agreeable or satisfactory. The total score ranges from 4 to 20. Higher scores indicate higher acceptability ratings.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ability to Cope with COVID-19</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>2 questions related to their ability to cope with stressors over the past two weeks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants answered these questions on a 7-point Likert Scale, from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree&quot;. Specifically, we asked participants: a) if they have been able to handle lifestyle changes due to the coronavirus and b) if the pandemic has had an extremely negative impact on their life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Secondary Control</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We administered three items to assess secondary control, derived from the Secondary Control Scale for Children (Weisz et al., 2010). The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (&quot;Very false&quot;) to 3 (&quot;Very true&quot;). Scores on each item range from 0-4, with higher scores indicating more secondary control.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Questionnaire measuring positive affect and negative affect. Scores on the positive affect subscale range from 10-50, with higher scores representing higher levels of positive affect. Scores on the negative affect subscale range from 10-50, with lower scores representing lower levels of negative affect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Utility Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were asked to rate three items relating to the perceived utility of each module. Specifically, we asked participants: How helpful the module was How engaging the module was How much they will continue applying content from the module. Higher scores indicate greater perceived utility.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Self-kindness subscale of the Self-Compassion Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self-compassion measure. We are using the 5-item self-kindness subscale. Participants will provide values ranging from 1 to 5. These values will be summed to create a total score on this scale ranging from 5 to 25, with higher scores representing higher levels of self-compassion.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Restructuring</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We administered three items to assess cognitive restructuring, derived from the cognitive reappraisal subscale of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire. Scores range from 3-21, with higher scores representing a higher amount of cognitive restructuring.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in items from the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Behavioral Activation Measure. We selected 3 items from the BADS to use to assess changes in behavioral activation. The scores for these three items are summed to give a total score from 0-18. Higher scores represent higher levels of behavioral activation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck Hopelessness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Hopelessness Questionnaire. Total score ranges from 0 to 4. Higher scores indicate less hope (more hopelessness).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in module-specific skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We are administering 4 items designed to detect cognitive or behavioral changes that relate to each intervention module.&#xD;
Cognitive restructuring: &quot;Over the past two weeks, I have been able to manage negative thoughts.&quot;&#xD;
Behavior activation: &quot;Over the past two weeks, I have intentionally spent time performing hobbies and activities that make me happy.&quot;&#xD;
Gratitude: &quot;Over the past two weeks, I have been able to focus my attention toward noticing and appreciating good things.&quot;&#xD;
Self-compassion: &quot;Over the past two weeks, I have been able to treat myself with empathy and compassion.&quot;&#xD;
