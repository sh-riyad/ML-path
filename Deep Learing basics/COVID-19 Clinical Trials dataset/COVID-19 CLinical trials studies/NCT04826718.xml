  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study finds opportunities and justifications, taking into consideration that the&#xD;
      nature of professional practice in health needs scientific evidence resulting from systematic&#xD;
      and systemic studies to strengthen the basis for the decisions made to have an impact on&#xD;
      various levels, from the patient to health management itself. In addition, Cabo Verdean&#xD;
      authorities may benefit from new evidence obtained by this study. It intends, in a growing&#xD;
      number of health professionals exposed or infected with SARS-CoV-2, involved at the front&#xD;
      line, in the different health structures of the country, to contribute to substantiate a&#xD;
      better perception of the problem and the required solutions. Therefore, assessing the&#xD;
      potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers will be essential to&#xD;
      characterize virus transmission, preventing future infections in them and providing the&#xD;
      associated healthcare. Due to the advances and important changes described, questions arise&#xD;
      that guide this research and allow us to identify the problem.&#xD;

      The problem is stated in the following starting questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - What conditions are associated with infection and non-infection by SARS-CoV-2 among health&#xD;
      professionals working in the three hospitals on the islands of Santiago and São Vicente? Who&#xD;
      are they (gender, age group, profession, type of contact, etc)? Where do they work (sector)?&#xD;
      When and how did the infection occur?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the frequency of antibody presence in professionals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
           infection?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long do anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies last?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is the impact of infection on unplanned absenteeism?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What complaints persist after SARS-CoV-2 infection?&#xD;

Collection of peripheral venous blood, in the cradle area, for analysis of the presence and duration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies will be done at the first interview, and after 3 and 6 months from selection, for all cases.&#xD;
The serological diagnosis consists of testing for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a blood sample, and whole blood, plasma, or serum can be used. The tests of choice will be based on the principle of immunoassay by immunochromatography and/or ELISA.</description>

        The population of the study is composed of health professionals working in the Hospitals of&#xD;
        the islands of Santiago and S. Vicente.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to measuring infection-related exposures, specific SARS-CoV-2 infection-related&#xD;
        parameters will also be assessed for cases, including presence and duration of&#xD;
        anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; absenteeism due to infection; and self-reported symptomatology&#xD;
        due to SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 infection. Cases will additionally be followed up for a period&#xD;
        of 6 months to measure unplanned, infection-related absenteeism and illness-related&#xD;
        symptomatology.&#xD;
