  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized Phase 2 trial will study the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in patients hospitalized with&#xD;
      confirmed COVID-19. The trial will include approximately 40 patients and is designed to&#xD;
      provide an early interim analysis of safety. Patients will be randomized using permuted block&#xD;
      randomization in a 1:1 fashion to either once-daily administration of bardoxolone methyl (20&#xD;
      mg) or matching placebo and treatment will be administered for the duration of&#xD;
      hospitalization (until recovery), with a maximum treatment duration of 29 days.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following randomization on Day 1, patients will be assessed while hospitalized on Days 3, 5,&#xD;
      8, 11, 15, 22, and 29. Assessments will include clinical status assessments, vital sign&#xD;
      measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event collection. Patients that&#xD;
      recover prior to Day 29 will complete an end-of-treatment visit. Patients will have an&#xD;
      in-person follow-up on Day 29, regardless of treatment adherence and recovery status prior to&#xD;
      Day 29, and a safety follow-up 60 days after randomization for clinical status assessments,&#xD;
      vital sign measurements, clinical chemistry collection, and adverse event collection.&#xD;
      Follow-up in-person visits are preferred but recognizing quarantine and other factors may&#xD;
      limit the subject's ability to return to the site for the visit. In this case, the visit may&#xD;
      be performed by phone. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will advise the study&#xD;
      leadership on safety aspects and overall progress of the study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>All patients, investigators, site personnel, laboratories, and study personnel with direct involvement in the conduct of the study or their designees will be blinded to treatment assignments. To prevent potential bias, appropriate measures will be taken to ensure the blind is maintained for the patients and personnel mentioned previously. To maintain the blind, investigators will distribute blinded study drug treatment to patients as directed by the IWRS system. Investigators and patients will not be blinded to dose level, but will be blinded to treatment assignment (i.e., bardoxolone methyl vs. placebo).</masking_description>
