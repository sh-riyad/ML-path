      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound is widely used in human medicine because it is safe, non-invasive, and painless.&#xD;
      The same kind of ultrasound that is used for imaging (for example, to visualize babies in&#xD;
      utero) may be able to treat inflammatory diseases including COVID-19. COVID-19 is a disease&#xD;
      caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some COVID-19 patients develop a severe&#xD;
      respiratory disease called acute respiratory distress syndrome and this disease is caused, in&#xD;
      part, by a significant increase in inflammatory factors. Clinical therapies that reduce this&#xD;
      elevated inflammation in the body (e.g., inflammation molecules in your body called&#xD;
      cytokines) may be capable of diminishing symptoms in severe cases of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies in animals with hyper-inflammation conditions (e.g., inflammatory arthritis&#xD;
      and sepsis/LPS injections) and recent human studies (e.g., for the treatment of joint&#xD;
      inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis) have shown that ultrasound applied to the spleen can&#xD;
      suppress blood/genetic markers of inflammation. Similar inflammatory markers, or cytokines,&#xD;
      are elevated in the lungs of COVID-19 patients and believed to cause severe symptoms. Splenic&#xD;
      ultrasound can potentially lower these inflammatory cytokines without hindering antibody&#xD;
      production, leading to clinical improvements in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will employ ultrasound devices produced by SecondWave Systems called the MINI&#xD;
      System (Miniature Immunotherapy and Neuromodulation Instrument System).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups in this study with 20 participants in each group. One group will&#xD;
      receive ultrasound application to the spleen, in addition to the standard clinical care. A&#xD;
      control group will receive standard clinical care without splenic ultrasound. Each ultrasound&#xD;
      application session will last about 30 minutes per day for 7 days, unless the participant is&#xD;
      discharged sooner. For ultrasound stimulation, a small wearable ultrasound device is&#xD;
      positioned on the upper left abdomen area over the ribs. The ultrasound session on the first&#xD;
      study day includes a period of 5-10 minutes when study personnel use an ultrasound imaging&#xD;
      device to locate the spleen and to position the wearable MINI device in a proper location&#xD;
      around the ribs area, and an approximately 18-minute period for application of ultrasound to&#xD;
      the spleen. Collection of clinical outcome data and daily blood draws will be performed in&#xD;
      each participant throughout the study through Day 8. Additional data collected from each&#xD;
      participant during their routine clinical care beyond their study involvement will also be&#xD;
      analyzed together with the study data to evaluate the specific aims of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Go to sections Study Type : Interventional (Clinical Trial) Estimated Enrollment&#xD;
      : 40 participants Allocation: Randomized Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Intervention&#xD;
      Model Description: The participants will be randomized to two groups: ultrasound group and&#xD;
      control group. All participants will still receive standard clinical care. The ultrasound&#xD;
      group will receive daily ultrasound application to the spleen for up to 7 days, in addition&#xD;
      to the standard clinical care. The control group will receive standard clinical care without&#xD;
      ultrasound stimulation.&#xD;
