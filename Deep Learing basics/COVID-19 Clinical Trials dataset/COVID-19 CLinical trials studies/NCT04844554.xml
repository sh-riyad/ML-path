  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COVID-19 has a variety of symptoms from asymptomatic respiratory dysfunction to death.&#xD;
      Considering the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its relationship with the neuroimmune&#xD;
      system, response, autonomic balance, musculoskeletal and respiratory and neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms presented by patients, the investigators highlight the potential use of non-invasive&#xD;
      neuromodulation methods to assess the effectiveness of treating patients with COVID-19, as&#xD;
      these techniques can be useful in the management of important clinical aspects in the&#xD;
      functional recovery of individuals affected by the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to evaluate the effects of HD- tDCS to promote ventilatory weaning&#xD;
      in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and to improve the respiratory&#xD;
      performance of those hospitalized in nursing beds for treatment of COVID - 19.&#xD;

    <description>Mechanical ventilation duration (MVD) and the creation of tracheostomy. A measurement of the duration of mechanical ventilation (MVD) will be defined as the time from intubation to the time of final extubation. Patients requiring reinstitution of mechanical ventilation after weaning were not considered separately but their total MVD was counted.</description>
