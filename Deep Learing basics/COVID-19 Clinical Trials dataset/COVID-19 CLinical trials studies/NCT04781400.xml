  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub Saharan Africa is home to only 12% of the population, but accounts for approximately 70%&#xD;
      of the global burden of HIV infection and 84% of infections among young people aged 10-24&#xD;
      years. South Africa, which currently has the largest SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in SSA, also has the&#xD;
      largest HIV epidemic globally. Access and service delivery barriers to engaging in HIV care&#xD;
      have contributed to estimates that only 49% of adolescents (aged 10-19 years) entering care&#xD;
      from 2005-2016 have initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART). In response to the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      pandemic the South African government has implemented national lock-down orders that we&#xD;
      predict will further inhibit treatment engagement among young people. Research is needed to&#xD;
      identify best practices for safely retaining young people living with HIV (YPLWH) in care&#xD;
      during COVID-19.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a remote service delivery model for young people living with HIV aged&#xD;
      13-24 years that will include a monthly service needs assessment and optional delivery of HIV&#xD;
      treatment services. YPLWH will also be randomized to receive (or not receive) mobile&#xD;
      check-ins from study staff and access to two-way messaging capabilities to obtain continuous&#xD;
      support for adherence to ART and COVID-19 prevention guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will also assess the impact of the COVID-19 lock-down orders on multi-level&#xD;
      factors (individual, socio-behavioral, structural) over time among young people aged 13-24&#xD;
      years living with HIV (same cohort as above) and without HIV. Particular focus will be given&#xD;
      to experience and perpetration of gender based violence. In addition, investigators will&#xD;
      assess the impact of multi-level factors on compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines,&#xD;
      health service utilization, and engagement in HIV care (YPLWH only). Findings will be&#xD;
      examined overall and stratified by HIV status and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately investigators hope to: (i) determine whether a remote service delivery model will&#xD;
      help retain young people in HIV care and (ii) Inform the development of an intervention for&#xD;
      young people in the study communities who may be experiencing GBV and associated outcomes in&#xD;
      the wake of the pandemic.&#xD;
