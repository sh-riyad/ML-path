  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine if subjects currently receiving treatment with&#xD;
      ocrelizumab or natalizumab produce antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor&#xD;
      binding domain following immunization with the COVID-19 vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients on ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) make antibodies in&#xD;
      response to the coronavirus vaccine. Ocrelizumab depletes B-lymphocytes and has the potential&#xD;
      to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. The impact of ocrelizumab treatment on coronavirus&#xD;
      vaccines is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natalizumab (Tysabri) likely has a minimal impact the efficacy of vaccines. In this study the&#xD;
      investigators will take blood samples in patients being treated with either ocrelizumab or&#xD;
      natalizumab before and after vaccination with an FDA-authorized coronavirus (COVID-19)&#xD;
      vaccine and compare the antibody response in both groups.&#xD;
