  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients on haemodialysis are at higher risk of getting a severe form of COVID-19 if they&#xD;
      become infected. Vaccinations are soon to arrive and offer great hope of controlling the&#xD;
      current pandemic. It is likely that patients on haemodialysis will be amongst the first&#xD;
      people to be offered vaccination against COVID-19 when they become available. While any&#xD;
      vaccines offered to these patients will be safe to receive, the effectiveness of the vaccines&#xD;
      at giving immunity to being infected with COVID-19 are not known as they have not been&#xD;
      explicitly tested in patients on haemodialysis. This study will involve having 3 blood tests&#xD;
      to test for an antibody response following vaccination for COVID-19. The first will be 1&#xD;
      month after the first vaccination dose to look at the initial antibody response and the&#xD;
      second and third will be 1 month and 6 months after the second vaccination dose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) on haemodialysis are more likely to suffer&#xD;
      poorer outcomes following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection. This is likely to be because these patients have higher levels of&#xD;
      co-morbid diseases and they are relatively immunosuppressed due to the effects of advanced&#xD;
      kidney disease. The humoral response against common viral vaccination is known to be blunted&#xD;
      in patients with ESKD and there are data to suggest seroconversion following infection with&#xD;
      COVID-19 is blunted in patients with kidney disease. A successful programme of vaccination&#xD;
      will undoubtedly improve outcomes for patients on haemodialysis, but vaccine testing&#xD;
      programmes have not included patients with ESKD. Whilst initial press-coverage of the&#xD;
      efficacy of vaccines which are available for use is promising, they are untested in patients&#xD;
      on haemodialysis who are known to be relatively immunosuppressed as a result of their renal&#xD;
      disease and as such the efficacy for this patient group is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will phenotype the IgG antibody response to vaccination for COVID-19 in 100&#xD;
      patients on haemodialysis compared to 50 healthy volunteers. Antibody testing will be&#xD;
      conducted at 1 month post first vaccination dose and 1 month and 6 months post second&#xD;
      vaccination dose. This will give crucial information as to the efficacy of the vaccine and&#xD;
      inform possible requirements for re-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phenotype the 1 month IgG antibody response to the first vaccination dose and the 1&#xD;
           month and 6 month response to the second vaccination dose for COVID-19 in patients on&#xD;
           haemodialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the 1 month IgG antibody response to the first vaccination dose and the 1 month&#xD;
           and 6 month response to the second vaccination dose for COVID-19 between patients on&#xD;
           haemodialysis and healthy volunteers&#xD;
