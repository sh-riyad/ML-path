  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label, Phase I, dose escalation study to investigate safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of one or two doses of intranasal ChAdOx1 nCOV-19, with randomisation between&#xD;
      one and two dose groups.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include up to 30 healthy adult participants, divided into 4 groups, two&#xD;
      receiving low dose vaccination and two receiving the higher dose, both intranasally. The&#xD;
      first group per dose will be the safety lead-in. All volunteers will be consented for receipt&#xD;
      of a booster vaccine (5x10^10vp ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 IN) at approximately 4 weeks post first&#xD;
      vaccine. Volunteers in Group 1 (1a and 1b, n=6) and Groups 2 (2a and 2b, n=24) will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated 1:1 to receive booster vaccine or not, stratified by first dose level.&#xD;
