      We aim to study the effect of a structured diabetes education program (DESMOND) on diabetes&#xD;
      outcomes in a ghanaian population over 3 months&#xD;

      Protocol summary Background: Health systems in low-income countries are overburdened. Corona&#xD;
      virus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a pandemic caused by a novel corona virus, Severe acute&#xD;
      respiratory syndrome-corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV2) while diabetes is a long-standing global&#xD;
      epidemic. COVID-19 further stresses the already overburdened health systems and Public Health&#xD;
      measures to contain COVID-19 have severely disrupted health service delivery, particularly&#xD;
      routine care. Delivery of diabetes specific education has traditionally been tied to routine&#xD;
      visits and delivered in-person. COVID-19 will likely continue to influence service delivery&#xD;
      beyond the pandemic, thus alternative ways of delivering diabetes specific education is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes self-management education is vital to providing diabetes care. It equips patients&#xD;
      with critical knowledge and skills for self-care. Recent edicts to stay home in relation to&#xD;
      COVID-19 have further heightened the importance of self-care. Appropriate self-management&#xD;
      behaviours are associated with lower levels of diabetes related distress, better quality of&#xD;
      life and diabetes outcomes overall. Maintaining tight glycaemic control, early in diabetes is&#xD;
      associated with fewer microvascular complications and vice versa. Complications of diabetes&#xD;
      are prevalent in low resource settings in Africa; partly because of inadequate knowledge on&#xD;
      self-care. Diabetes self-management education which is structured and tailor-made for low&#xD;
      resource settings may modify self-care behaviors and result in improved self-care, glycaemic&#xD;
      control and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare structured diabetes self-management education with standard of care among adults&#xD;
      living with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective parallel-group randomised controlled trial with three months follow-up will be&#xD;
      conducted in KBTH Polyclinic/Family Medicine Centre and Weija Gbawe Municipal Hospital, two&#xD;
      primary care facilities in Accra. Participants will be individually randomised to standard of&#xD;
      care or 6 hours of structured diabetes self-management education (DSME) delivered in person&#xD;
      on one day . Each arm will have hundred participants. The standard of care arm will receive&#xD;
      unstructured DSME as per existing protocols at each study site. The study population will be&#xD;
      adults living with diabetes. The primary outcome, mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c ) will be&#xD;
      measured at three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that there will be no difference in change in mean glycaemic control,&#xD;
      self-efficacy or quality of life at three months between the two arms.&#xD;
