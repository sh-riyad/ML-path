  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glatt Pharmaceutical Services GmbH &amp; Co. KG is developing a new CBD granules formulation&#xD;
      (GLA-015 / Cannabidiol 1500 mg 29,7% w/w GRA BLD P) which is intended to be used in the&#xD;
      treatment of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Due to its enhanced solubility the&#xD;
      new product is expected to show increased bioavailability, reduced variability especially in&#xD;
      the fasted state and better robustness towards food interaction compared to oil-based&#xD;
      cannabidiol solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present clinical trial is the characterisation of maximum systemic exposure of&#xD;
      CBD and its active metabolite 7-OH-CBD of the newly developed Test product in the estimated&#xD;
      target effective dose for treatment of COVID-19 as well as the comparison of its systemic&#xD;
      bioavailability to CBD administered as oily solution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of maximum systemic exposure of Test vs. Reference will be performed under steady&#xD;
      state conditions with twice daily intake after a light meal over 7 consecutive days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single centre, open-label, randomised (order of treatments), balanced, multiple dose&#xD;
      trial will be performed in a 2-period, 2-sequence-crossover design with direct switch-over.&#xD;
      Eighteen (18) healthy subjects of both sexes (balanced distribution intended, but minimum 40%&#xD;
      of each sex) are intended to be randomised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMPs will be administered after a light meal as single oral doses of 1500 mg cannabidiol&#xD;
      (i.e. 5.051 g granules of Test to be dispersed in water or 15 ml solution of Reference) twice&#xD;
      daily (i.e. every 12 h) over 7 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood sampling will be performed after the 13th administration over 24 h, thereby including&#xD;
      the 14th administration, in order to characterise pharmacokinetic parameters after multiple&#xD;
      dosing over a whole day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of maximum systemic exposure of Test vs. Reference will be performed under steady&#xD;
      state conditions by means of AUC144-168,ss, Cmax,144-168,ss, and Cmin,144-168,ss of CBD and&#xD;
      7-OH-CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will be performed as a cross-over investigation with intra-individual&#xD;
      comparison, thus reducing variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters, which is supposed to&#xD;
      be higher between subjects than within an individual subject.&#xD;
