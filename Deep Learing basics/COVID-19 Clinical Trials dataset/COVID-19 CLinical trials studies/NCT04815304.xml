    <textblock>
      At the moment of intensive care unit admission and during the in intensive care unit staying,&#xD;
      the following data were collected: peripheral lymphocyte subsets were measured by&#xD;
      multiple-color flow cytometry, chest computed tomography and ultrasonography scans, arterial&#xD;
      blood gas parameters (pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, partial pressure of oxygen,&#xD;
      concentration of hydrogen carbonate, base excess, and arterial oxygen saturation), and pain&#xD;
      assessed by using numeric rating scale.&#xD;
