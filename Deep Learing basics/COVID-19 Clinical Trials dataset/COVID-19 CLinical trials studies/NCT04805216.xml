  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UK Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted temporary&#xD;
      authorisation to three Covid-19 vaccines in December 2020 and January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These vaccinations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Covid-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ChAdOx1-S vaccine (Astra Zeneca vaccine);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Covid-19 mRNA vaccine (Moderna vaccine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any other Covid-19 vaccines approved for use by the MHRA in immunocompromised and&#xD;
      immunocompetent patients are to be included in this study. The above vaccines have received&#xD;
      temporary authorisation after placebo-controlled phase 3 studies confirmed their safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in over 100,000 volunteers. People who were immunocompromised or were receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunoglobulin treatment were excluded from these studies.&#xD;
      Safety, efficacy, and durability of antibody response in these studies has been assessed for&#xD;
      up to 14 weeks only. These vaccines are being rolled out in the UK and have been recommended&#xD;
      for use for immunosuppressed individuals including patients undergoing chemotherapy,&#xD;
      immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and those who have undergone stem cell transplantation. Though&#xD;
      the MHRA has approved vaccination for immunocompromised patients there is no published&#xD;
      evidence to confirm safety and efficacy in these patients. The durability of antibody&#xD;
      response and whether this is affected by concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy&#xD;
      treatment is also unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to evaluate the immune response to Covid-19 vaccines in&#xD;
      haematology patients who have immune suppression either due to disease, treatment, or both.&#xD;
      The investigators plan to measure Anti-SARS-COV2 IgG antibody levels at specified time points&#xD;
      until 120 days after patients have received their 1st dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect any adverse events reported by patient including Covid-19&#xD;
      infection or disease after vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study plans to recruit 50 haematology patients who are clinically assessed by a&#xD;
      haematologist as immunosuppressed due to their disease, treatment, or both. The study also&#xD;
      plans to recruit 30 healthy (immunocompetent) volunteers who would be the control group for&#xD;
      comparison of antibody response and durability.&#xD;
