  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of Famotidine in the clinical recovery of&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients. COVID19 is a worldwide pandemic. Hence SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus; there&#xD;
      is no specific medication against it. Like other countries of the world, Besides antiviral&#xD;
      drugs, immunosuppressive agents, and symptomatic therapy like H2 receptor blocker FAMOTIDINE&#xD;
      came to the limelight due to its role in reducing the symptoms of COVID-19 patients. The&#xD;
      study will include COVID-19 participants to confirm by RT PCR or an HRCT chest. Detail&#xD;
      history of each participant with comorbidity will be taken and will be examined carefully.&#xD;
      The hospitalized patients admitted to the HDU/ICU units will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Critically ill patients who require ventilator support will not be included in this study.&#xD;
      The outcome of the Famotidine treatment will be evaluated and compared with a control group.&#xD;
