    <textblock>
      As an important non-drug intervention in the treatment of respiratory tract diseases,&#xD;
      respiratory rehabilitation training is increasingly accepted in clinical practice. The&#xD;
      purpose of pulmonary rehabilitation is not only to improve the physical and mental conditions&#xD;
      of the patient, but also to help the patient return to the family and society more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the widely documented lung injuries associated with COVID-19, concerns are raised&#xD;
      regarding the assessment of lung injury in discharged patients. As an important non-drug&#xD;
      intervention in the treatment of respiratory diseases, respiratory rehabilitation training is&#xD;
      increasingly being accepted in clinical practice The purpose of pulmonary rehabilitation is&#xD;
      not only to improve the physical and mental conditions of the patient, but also to help the&#xD;
      patient return to the family and society more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study; It is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of breathing exercise in&#xD;
      individuals with COVID-19.&#xD;
