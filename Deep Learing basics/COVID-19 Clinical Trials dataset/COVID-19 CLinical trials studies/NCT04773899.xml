  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells through the binding of the spike protein with angiotensin&#xD;
      converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a membrane receptor highly expressed in immune or non-immune&#xD;
      cells, and in many organs, including lungs and endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COVID-19 disease, the infection of endothelial might cause an acute endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate that patients COVID19 (+) hospitalized in ICU&#xD;
      present an acute endothelial dysfunction (compared with COVID19 (-) also hospitalized in&#xD;
      ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This acute endothelial dysfunction could lead to organ failure, systemic immune dysregulation&#xD;
      and thrombosis.&#xD;

      This cohort study compares 3 exposure cohorts :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C1 includes COVID19 (+) patients admitted in ICU in whom the diagnosis of COVID19&#xD;
      pneumonia was confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C2 includes COVID 19 (-) matched patients also admitted in ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C3 is a control group. Patients with few comorbidities, ASA 1, recruited during&#xD;
      preoperative assessment for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are included within 72 hours of ICU admission (C1, C2) or during the&#xD;
      preoperative assessment (C3). Oral consent is needed after complete explanation of the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During inclusion visit (V0), patient characteristics as treatments, medical history, clinical&#xD;
      and biological data are registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microcirculation is assessed for each patient directly after inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in C1 and C2 a follow-up is planned. This visit (V1) occurs when the patient is&#xD;
      discharged from ICU or the day of his death if it occurs in ICU. In case of prolonged stay in&#xD;
      ICU, V1 is carried out 2 months after inclusion. During V1, arterial and/or venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic events and mortality in ICU is registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Patients in C3, no follow-up is planned.&#xD;
