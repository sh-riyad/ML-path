    <textblock>
      Sedation of severe COVID-19 disease are often complicated. We try to find a correlate for&#xD;
      this observation by encephalographic studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation of critically ill ventilated coronavirus patients, continues to be a challenging&#xD;
      issue. Also, neurological symptoms of severe COVID-19 disease have been described frequently.&#xD;
      Difficulties in sedation of these patients have been discussed repeatedly. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate whether an encephalographic correlate can be found. Appropriate&#xD;
      processed encephalographic techniques have been used for anesthesia monitoring for many&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to collect unrelated processed and raw EEG data of sedated COVID-19&#xD;
      patients and to investigate the correlation to the necessary sedation.&#xD;
