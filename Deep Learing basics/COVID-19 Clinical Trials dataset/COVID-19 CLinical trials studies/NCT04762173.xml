    <textblock>
      This is a study on internet-based self-help for stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
      College and university students who score in the moderate or higher range on a stress measure&#xD;
      during the COVID-19 pandemic will be invited to participate in this study. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive access to an internet-based self-help program for stress&#xD;
      resilience and coping with the COVID-19 pandemic or care as usual. Stress and psychosocial&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed via questionnaire at baseline (pre-randomization), one month&#xD;
      post-randomization, and three months post-randomization.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are provided access to two online self-help programs provided by SilverCloud Health. One program is designed to support general stress resilience using principles and techniques from positive psychology and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The other program is designed to support coping with pandemic-related stressors using psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral therapy and grief therapy principles. Participants have access to both programs and can proceed through them in the order and pace of their choosing. The online self-help intervention is fully self-guided.</description>
