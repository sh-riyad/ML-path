  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge for the French healthcare system, particularly among the&#xD;
      elderly due to their particular vulnerability to the serious consequences of the disease,&#xD;
      with an estimated mortality rate of around 30-35% among the frail elderly. The management of&#xD;
      the health crisis could take a new turn in 2021 with the arrival in France of vaccines&#xD;
      against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this vaccination campaign are to reduce the morbi-mortality attributable to&#xD;
      COVID-19 on the one hand, and to maintain essential activities related to the functioning of&#xD;
      the country on the other hand and in particular the health system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the distrust of vaccination, traditionally strong in France, could have a negative&#xD;
      impact on this strategy. While the President of the Republic announced on November 24, 2020&#xD;
      that vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 would not be made compulsory, almost one French person in&#xD;
      two declared in several surveys that they did not want to be vaccinated; the main criterion&#xD;
      for acceptance of vaccination being advanced age (the older they are, the more French people&#xD;
      declare accepting to be vaccinated).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the gradual vaccine supply schedule for the year 2021, the French National&#xD;
      Authority for Health established at the end of 2020 a prioritization by vaccine availability&#xD;
      phases. The critical initial supply phase,which is currently taking place, is the one during&#xD;
      which residents of retirement home and long-term care units are prioritized because of their&#xD;
      particular vulnerability (age and co-morbidities) and their increased exposure to SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, and in order to carry out the current vaccination campaign in the most&#xD;
      optimal way possible, this national survey is launching to evaluate the acceptance rate of&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine among people living in retirement homes and long-term care units, to&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms of acceptance or rejection, and to draw up an initial large-scale&#xD;
      inventory of the symptoms observed following vaccination.&#xD;
