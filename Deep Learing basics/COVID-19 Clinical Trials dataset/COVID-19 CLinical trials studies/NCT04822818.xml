  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most frequent&#xD;
      complications of the COVID-19 pandemic. In these conditions, hypoxemia may result from : i) a&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular dilatation resulting from an impaired hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction&#xD;
      and leading to ventilation-perfusion mismatching within the lungs and ii) thrombosis-mediated&#xD;
      perfusion defects. Pulmonary vascular dilation might be due to a relative failure of the&#xD;
      physiological acute hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, in the context of an over-activation&#xD;
      of a regional vasodilatation cascade, as part of a dysfunctional inflammatory process.&#xD;
      Perfusion abnormalities associated with pulmonary vascular dilation are suggestive of&#xD;
      intrapulmonary shunting toward areas where gas exchange is impaired, ultimately leading to a&#xD;
      worsening ventilation-perfusion mismatch, a regional hypoxia and a profound hypoxemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased plasma levels of VEGF have been reported in moderate to severe COVID-19 pneumonia,&#xD;
      highlighting the role of VEGF in the pathophysiology of the disease. A better prognosis has&#xD;
      been reported in critically ill patients with lower levels of growth factors, HGF and VEGF-A&#xD;
      at the time of ICU admission. Recent data of the study NCT 04275414 by Pang J et al have&#xD;
      suggested that patients receiving a single-dose of bevacizumab have improved their oxygen&#xD;
      support status in 92% of cases during a 28-day follow-up period, as compared with 62% of&#xD;
      cases in an external cohort receiving standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correcting endothelial permeability and vasodilatation with VEGF-targeted therapy could allow&#xD;
      repair damaged vascular endothelium, have an indirect anti-inflammatory effect (limiting&#xD;
      alveolar exudation of circulating inflammatory and procoagulant mediators) and improve&#xD;
      oxygenation and therefore reduce the proportion of patients with severe forms requiring ICU&#xD;
      referral and finally patient death. This clinical trial will therefore focus on the specific&#xD;
      efficacy of bevacizumab in COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxemia.&#xD;
