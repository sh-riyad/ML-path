    <textblock>
      Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is a heterogeneous disease with a wide&#xD;
      range of treatment options from the medical follow-up to early invasive treatment due to&#xD;
      complete occlusion of the culprit artery. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (NSTEMI-ACS) is one of the subcomponents of NSTE-ACS, which has an&#xD;
      increased mortality rate, and for which early intervention can be vital. Yet, most of these&#xD;
      patients require invasive treatment. In fact, some of them are patients who require very&#xD;
      early invasive treatment and have a complete occlusion in the culprit artery. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      risk scoring systems are not sufficient enough to differentiate these patients. Therefore,&#xD;
      the discovery of markers that can be used in the differentiation of NSTEMI-ACS patients with&#xD;
      an increased need for invasive treatment and/or complete occlusion of the culprit's vessels,&#xD;
      especially during pandemic periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has gained importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation is known to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. To the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of literature on the relationship&#xD;
      between the need for invasive treatment strategy and/or complete occlusion of the culprit's&#xD;
      vessel, and the hematological markers in patients diagnosed with NSTEMI-ACS.&#xD;

      Non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) is a heterogeneous disease with a wide&#xD;
      range of treatment options from the medical follow-up to early invasive treatment due to&#xD;
      complete occlusion of the culprit artery. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (NSTEMI-ACS) is one of the subcomponents of NSTE-ACS, which has an&#xD;
      increased mortality rate, and for which early intervention can be vital. In the European&#xD;
      Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, NSTEMI-ACS is defined as a high-risk condition that&#xD;
      requires diagnostic angiography within 2 hours at the latest in those with very high-risk&#xD;
      criteria and within 24 hours at the latest in those who do not have high risk. However, the&#xD;
      non-invasive approach has come to the fore for the NSTEMI-ACS disease due to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic conditions. In the recently published national consensus report, during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic period, medium-high risk NSTEMI-ACS patients are recommended optimal medical therapy&#xD;
      as an alternative treatment method, even if the diagnosis of COVID-19 was excluded,&#xD;
      especially in areas where pandemic effects are being experienced intensely. Yet, most of&#xD;
      these patients require invasive treatment. In fact, some of them are patients who require&#xD;
      very early invasive treatment and have a complete occlusion in the culprit artery.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, risk scoring systems are not sufficient enough to differentiate these&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, the discovery of markers that can be used in the differentiation of&#xD;
      NSTEMI-ACS patients with an increased need for invasive treatment and/or complete occlusion&#xD;
      of the culprit's vessels, especially during pandemic periods such as the COVID-19 pandemic,&#xD;
      has gained importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation is known to play an important role in the etiopathogenesis of coronary artery&#xD;
      disease. In recent years, it has been shown that hematological parameters closely associated&#xD;
      with inflammation in people with coronary artery disease may be useful in distinguishing&#xD;
      those with increased severity of atherosclerotic involvement and those with high mortality&#xD;
      risk. The main markers used in studies are Leukocyte count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio&#xD;
      (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), systemic immune inflammation index (SII), red blood&#xD;
      cell distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV). To the best of our knowledge,&#xD;
      there is a lack of literature on the relationship between the need for invasive treatment&#xD;
      strategy and/or complete occlusion of the culprit's vessel, and the hematological markers in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with NSTEMI-ACS.&#xD;
