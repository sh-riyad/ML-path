  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an adaptive phase 2/3, randomized, controlled multicenter study on the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of Reparixin in the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19&#xD;
      pneumonia. 48 patients are planned to be enrolled in Phase 2 and an estimated total of 111&#xD;
      patients are planned to be enrolled up to the end of Phase 3, with a randomization 2:1&#xD;
      Reparixin vs Control (Standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 segment of this study, patients are randomized 2:1 to Reparixin oral tablets&#xD;
      1200 mg (Group 1, active treatment) or standard of care (Group 2, control arm). In case of&#xD;
      worsening (e.g. need of ICU and/or mechanical ventilation) after the first 24hrs, patients&#xD;
      are offered a rescue medication with no restriction from the sponsor and fully based on their&#xD;
      physicians' judgement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 3 segment of this study, it is planned that patients are randomized 2:1 to&#xD;
      Reparixin or standard of care. The Phase 3 design will be reassessed and decided based on the&#xD;
      results of the Phase 2.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The sponsor has decided to start with a separate protocol for phase 3 and therefore this study&#xD;
    was terminated with only phase 2.&#xD;

    <description>The time to clinical improvement of two points from the time of randomization on a seven-category ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital, whichever comes first. The seven-category ordinal scale consists of the following:&#xD;
1) not hospitalized, with resumption of normal activities; 2) not hospitalized, but unable to resume normal activities; 3) hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4) hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5) hospitalized, requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or both; 6) hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7) death.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of dyspnea is measured through the Liker scale. The Liker scale is used as follows: the patient grades his current breathing compared to when he first started the drug (from -3 to 3). &quot;0&quot; = no change, &quot;1&quot; =minimally better, &quot;2&quot; =moderately better, &quot;3&quot; =markedly better, &quot;-1&quot; =minimally worse, &quot;-2&quot; =moderately worse, &quot;-3&quot; =markedly worse.</description>

    <description>The severity of dyspnea is measured also through the VAS scale. The VAS scale is used as follows: the patient draws a horizontal line on an axial graph (from 0 to 100) to show the degree of how he feels about breathing. The number &quot;0&quot; equals the worst breathing the patient has ever felt and the number &quot;100&quot; equals the best he has ever felt.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>PaO2 measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood and how well oxygen is able to move from the airspace of the lungs into the blood.&#xD;
Normally, PaO2 is between 75 and 100 mmHg (at sea level). Lower levels indicate an unsufficient amount of oxygen flowing from the alveoli to the blood.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>SpO2 measures the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood relative to the amount of hemoglobin not carrying oxygen. Acceptable normal ranges for patients without pulmonary pathology are from 95 to 99 percent.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>PaO2/FiO2 ratio is the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2 in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2 expressed as a fraction, not a percentage) also known as the Horowitz index, the Carrico index, and (most conveniently) the P/F ratio at sea level, the normal PaO2/FiO2 ratio is ~ 400-500 mmHg (~55-65 kPa).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>For a standard CRP test, a normal reading is less than 10 milligram per liter (mg/L). Levels between 10 mg/L and 100 mg/L are moderately elevated and are usually due to more significant inflammation from an infectious or non-infectious cause. Inflammatory status is documented by C-reactive protein (CRP) ≥ 100mg/L.</description>

    <measure>Phase 2/3 Secondary Endpoint: Hs-CRP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, day 1, day 2, week 1, day 21(end of treatment), follow-up (FU) (7±3 days after treatment period)</time_frame>
    <description>The hs-CRP test detects lower levels of CRP in the bloodstream (0.5-10 mg/L), whereas the CRP test measures levels in a higher range (10-1,000 mg/L).</description>
