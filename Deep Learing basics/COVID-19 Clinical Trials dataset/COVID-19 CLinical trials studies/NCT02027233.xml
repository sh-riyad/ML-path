    <textblock>
      This study assesses the seasonal of influenza vaccine effectiveness in adults hospitalised&#xD;
      with laboratory-confirmed influenza through a network of hospitals in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, To better understand the burden of other respiratory viruses such as respiratory&#xD;
      syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized adults, we need to describe and quantify&#xD;
      the population hospitalized due to theses other respiratory viruses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza vaccination strategies aim at protecting high-risk population from severe outcomes.&#xD;
      Estimating the effectiveness of seasonal vaccines against influenza related hospitalisation&#xD;
      is important to guide these strategies. The main objective is to measure the population&#xD;
      effectiveness of influenza vaccine in patients hospitalized with virologically confirmed&#xD;
      influenza laboratory result during all influenza seasons from 2013/2014 to 2021/2022 in a&#xD;
      French hospital network. An interim analysis is provided for each influenza season and a&#xD;
      global analysis of all seasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year, we also collect data from other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial&#xD;
      virus (RSV) on the hospitalized population. The data for three years confirm that, although&#xD;
      RSV is less common than influenza in patients with flu-like symptom (4% of 1452 patients), it&#xD;
      is responsible for serious complications at a higher frequency than influenza, especially in&#xD;
      the elderly and immunosuppressed patients. To better understand the burden of disease of RSV&#xD;
      infection in hospitalized adults, we need to start patients recruitment sooner at the start&#xD;
      of the VRS epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the recent emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and our participation in European projects&#xD;
      within the framework of COVID-19 surveillance, the FLUVAC study is an opportunity to collect&#xD;
      additional data in patients hospitalized with a severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) which&#xD;
      may be due to respiratory infection with an influenza virus or other respiratory viruses&#xD;
      including SARS-CoV-2. We therefore propose to collect clinical (chronic diseases,&#xD;
      comorbidities, intensive care), epidemiological and virological data throughout the year in&#xD;
      adult patients hospitalized for suspected CO-VID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a study &quot;case-control&quot; involving a nasopharyngeal sample for all hospitalised&#xD;
      patients presenting a SARI within seven days. Cases will be patients RT-PCR positive for&#xD;
      influenza. Controls will be patients negative for any influenza virus.&#xD;
