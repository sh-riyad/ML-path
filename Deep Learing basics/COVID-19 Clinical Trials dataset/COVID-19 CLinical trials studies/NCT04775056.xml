  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a worldwide&#xD;
      pandemic. Considering its high mortality and rapid spread, an effective vaccine is urgently&#xD;
      needed to control this pandemic. Recently, mass vaccination campaigns using newly approved&#xD;
      vaccines, ranging from conventional viral and protein-based vaccines to those that are more&#xD;
      cutting edge, including DNA- and mRNA-based vaccines are beginning in many parts of the&#xD;
      world. Randomized clinical trials of different vaccines reported efficacies for preventing&#xD;
      COVID-19 in the range of 50% to 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although these randomized clinical trials are considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for evaluating&#xD;
      intervention effects, they have notable limitations of sample size and subgroup analysis,&#xD;
      restrictive inclusion criteria, and a highly controlled setting that may not be replicated in&#xD;
      a mass vaccine rollout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy&#xD;
      of different vaccines against COVID-19 under real-world practice conditions.&#xD;
