  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The newly recognised disease COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome&#xD;
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which by early December 2019 had spread from China to the rest of&#xD;
      the world, especially Europe, the United States, Latin America, and India, with over 86&#xD;
      million confirmed cases and over 1.870.000 deaths (5th January, 2021). The clinical spectrum&#xD;
      of SARSCoV- 2 infection is wide, encompassing asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and even death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to retrospective data from China regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19, at the time of admission to hospital, the most common symptoms were cough (67.8%),&#xD;
      fever (43%), and fatigue (38.1%), and less frequently myalgia/arthralgia (14.9%), a sore&#xD;
      throat (13.9%) and headache (13.6), while nausea or vomiting (5.0%) and diarrhoea (3.8%) were&#xD;
      uncommon. Similar clinical characteristics are also encountered in European and US COVID-19&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the rising global death toll associated with the pandemic, in the past few months we&#xD;
      have witnessed a race to find drug/biological treatments to save the lives of hospitalized,&#xD;
      severely ill patients, as well as to develop vaccines. To this end, randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials are underway to test experimental drug candidates, or repurposed medicines. At this&#xD;
      time, it is crucial to focus on primary care physicians and initial mild symptoms at home in&#xD;
      COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently recommendations have been produced to treat this illness at home based on the&#xD;
      pathophysiologic and the pharmacologic rationale and the available clinical evidence of&#xD;
      efficacy in COVID-19 patients, including results of published clinical trials, for each of&#xD;
      the recommended class of drugs. These recommendations have taken advantage from the long term&#xD;
      experience of an infection disease specialist and other clinicians of Bergamo Hospital, who&#xD;
      used their know-how and sound judgment to treat COVID-19 patients at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the common early mild symptoms of COVID-19 highlight a systemic inflammatory process,&#xD;
      there is the recommendation of using anti-inflammatory agents to limit excessive host&#xD;
      inflammatory responses to the viral infection, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      drugs and corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, COVID-19 is a particularly debilitating illness, and, apart from causing patients&#xD;
      to be bedridden, there is evidence that in SARS-CoV-2 infection, dysregulation of the&#xD;
      coagulation cascade and fibrinolytic system occur. Therefore, COVID-19 patients are exposed&#xD;
      to the risk of thromboembolic events, independently of age, and anticoagulant prophylaxis is&#xD;
      recommended, unless contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparative analysis of patient cohorts with long-enough follow-up in everyday clinical&#xD;
      practice may offer a good alternative to randomized clinical trials to evaluate effectiveness&#xD;
      of novel therapies. Thus, we will use this approach in an observational retrospective&#xD;
      matched-cohort study to compare a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated at home by their family&#xD;
      phisicians according to the proposed recommendations with another cohort of similar patients&#xD;
      treated with other therapeutic regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our working hypothesis is that following the recommendations the inflammatory processes and&#xD;
      thus symptoms resolve faster than with other therapeutic approaches, while safe achieving&#xD;
      similar rates of complete remission of the illness.&#xD;
